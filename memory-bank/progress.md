# Progress Tracking

## Completed Features
- Basic microservices architecture
- Service communication patterns
- Authentication system
- Basic Explore Service functionality

### Caching Infrastructure

- ✅ Implemented Redis caching architecture in ExploreService
- ✅ Created specialized exception hierarchy for cache operations
- ✅ Added timeout handling and fallback strategies
- ✅ Implemented structured logging for cache operations
- ✅ Created developer documentation for consistent cache implementation
- ✅ Added response time optimization through strategic caching

## In Progress
- Redis caching implementation for Explore Service
  - Cache service design
  - Cache manager implementation
  - Integration with existing services
  - Health monitoring setup

### Caching Improvements

- 🔄 Implementing circuit breaker pattern for Redis operations
- 🔄 Adding cache health monitoring and observability
- 🔄 Creating multi-level caching with in-memory L1 cache

## Pending Features
- Advanced caching strategies
- Cache warming implementation
- Redis clustering
- Advanced monitoring
- Performance optimization

## Planned Features

### Caching Roadmap

- 📝 Implement cache invalidation events using pub/sub
- 📝 Add distributed locking for concurrent operations
- 📝 Create admin tools for cache inspection and management

## Known Issues
- Cache consistency needs monitoring
- Memory usage optimization required
- Connection management improvements needed
- Cache invalidation complexity to be addressed

## Next Steps
1. Complete Redis caching implementation
2. Implement health checks
3. Set up monitoring
4. Test cache performance
5. Document implementation

## Success Metrics
- Cache hit ratio > 80%
- Response time < 500ms
- Memory usage within limits
- Connection stability
- Error rate < 1%

## What Works

### Core Services
- Authentication and Authorization (JWT-based)
- Basic conversation management
- Chat functionality with Ollama models
- Streaming and non-streaming responses
- User management

### API Endpoints
- User registration and login
- Create, read, update, delete conversations
- Send chat messages with streaming or non-streaming responses
- Search conversations
- Manage user profiles
- Explore available models

### Data Storage
- SQL Server database integration
- Entity Framework Core models and repositories
- Redis caching for improved performance

## Recent Improvements
- Advanced input validation for chat requests with parameter constraints
- Enhanced validation for model options like temperature and penalties
- Optimized dependency injection for validators
- Comprehensive Redis cache configuration in appsettings.json
- Structured validation error responses

## What's Left to Build

### Features
- Implement search functionality for conversations
- Advanced caching strategies for chat history
- File attachment handling
- Conversation export/import
- Analytics dashboard

### Technical Improvements
- Integration tests for validators
- Performance monitoring for cache hit/miss rates
- Document clear patterns for validator usage
- Additional metrics and logging
- Frontend UI improvements

## Known Issues
- Search implementation is incomplete in ConversationService
- Redis connection timeout handling needs testing
- Edge case validation for very large models not implemented

## Current Status
Currently improving validation and caching functionality. Core chat and conversation features are working. Search functionality is being implemented. The system is functional but some advanced features are still in development.
