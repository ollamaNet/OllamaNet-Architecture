# Progress Tracking

## Completed Features
- Basic microservices architecture
- Service communication patterns
- Authentication system
- Basic Explore Service functionality

### Caching Infrastructure

- ✅ Implemented Redis caching architecture in ExploreService
- ✅ Created specialized exception hierarchy for cache operations
- ✅ Added timeout handling and fallback strategies
- ✅ Implemented structured logging for cache operations
- ✅ Created developer documentation for consistent cache implementation
- ✅ Added response time optimization through strategic caching

## In Progress
- Redis caching implementation for Explore Service
  - Cache service design
  - Cache manager implementation
  - Integration with existing services
  - Health monitoring setup

### Caching Improvements

- 🔄 Implementing circuit breaker pattern for Redis operations
- 🔄 Adding cache health monitoring and observability
- 🔄 Creating multi-level caching with in-memory L1 cache

## Pending Features
- Advanced caching strategies
- Cache warming implementation
- Redis clustering
- Advanced monitoring
- Performance optimization

## Planned Features

### Caching Roadmap

- 📝 Implement cache invalidation events using pub/sub
- 📝 Add distributed locking for concurrent operations
- 📝 Create admin tools for cache inspection and management

## Known Issues
- Cache consistency needs monitoring
- Memory usage optimization required
- Connection management improvements needed
- Cache invalidation complexity to be addressed

## Next Steps
1. Complete Redis caching implementation
2. Implement health checks
3. Set up monitoring
4. Test cache performance
5. Document implementation

## Success Metrics
- Cache hit ratio > 80%
- Response time < 500ms
- Memory usage within limits
- Connection stability
- Error rate < 1%
