# Product Context for OllamaNet

## Problem Statement
Modern AI applications require sophisticated integration with large language models (LLMs) for conversational capabilities. Developers need a robust, scalable platform that simplifies LLM deployment, management, and interaction while providing secure access, efficient resource utilization, and comprehensive administration. Current solutions often lack proper organization, streaming capabilities, or scalable architecture for production use. Additionally, LLMs often struggle with context limitations and up-to-date information, requiring enhanced capabilities like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Solution Overview
Providing a comprehensive microservices platform for integrating Open source's large language model capabilities into applications through a clean, modular architecture. The platform offers conversation management, real-time chat with streaming responses, user authentication, administrative controls, and model exploration capabilities in a cohesive ecosystem. The platform enhances AI model responses through RAG capabilities, allowing conversations to be grounded in specific documents and knowledge bases.
