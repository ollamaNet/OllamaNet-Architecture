## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Message Queue Implementation
- Using RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication
- Focus on admin and background tasks
- Implementing progress tracking for long-running operations

### Service Communication
- Synchronous communication for real-time operations
- Asynchronous communication for background tasks
- Event-driven architecture for cross-service notifications

### Database Strategy
- **Shared Database Approach**
  - Single database instance for all services
  - Unified data access layer
  - Shared schema for common entities
  - Service-specific schemas where needed
  - Centralized data consistency
  - Simplified transaction management
  - Reduced operational complexity
  - Caching for performance optimization

### Security Considerations
- Implementing JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Secure service-to-service communication
- Data encryption at rest

## Current Challenges
1. **Technical**
   - Ensuring reliable message delivery
   - Managing service dependencies
   - Implementing effective monitoring
   - Handling distributed transactions

2. **Architectural**
   - Balancing synchronous vs asynchronous operations
   - Managing service boundaries
   - Ensuring scalability
   - Maintaining consistency

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Technical Risks**
   - Implementing circuit breakers
   - Setting up monitoring and alerts
   - Establishing backup and recovery procedures
   - Implementing graceful degradation

2. **Architectural Risks**
   - Documenting service contracts
   - Implementing versioning strategy
   - Establishing rollback procedures
   - Setting up testing environments
