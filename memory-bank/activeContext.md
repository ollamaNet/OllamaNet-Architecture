# Active Context for OllamaNet Platform

## Current Focus

The OllamaNet platform is currently focused on the following key areas:

1. **Documentation and Knowledge Management**
   - Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation across all services
   - Documenting architectural patterns, technical implementations, and service relationships
   - Capturing implementation insights and design decisions

2. **Caching Strategy Optimization**
   - Refining the Redis-based caching implementation across services
   - Optimizing TTL values for different data types
   - Implementing resilient fallback mechanisms
   - Enhancing cache monitoring and invalidation strategies

3. **Streaming Implementation**
   - Optimizing the Server-Sent Events implementation in ConversationService
   - Ensuring proper cancellation support and resource management
   - Improving background processing for post-streaming operations

4. **Search Functionality Enhancement**
   - Addressing limitations in the current search implementation
   - Moving from in-memory filtering to database-level search
   - Optimizing query performance for conversation search

5. **Cross-Service Integration**
   - Ensuring consistent authentication across all services
   - Maintaining API design consistency
   - Coordinating shared database access patterns

## Active Decisions

### Architectural Decisions
- **Shared Database Approach**: Using a single database instance with shared schema for simplified data consistency
- **Clean Architecture Pattern**: Implementing controllers, services, and repositories across all microservices
- **Service Registration**: Centralizing service registration in ServiceExtensions.cs files
- **Gateway Configuration**: Using modular configuration files for maintainability

### Implementation Decisions
- **Caching Strategy**: Implementing Redis-based distributed caching with domain-specific TTL values and fallback mechanisms
- **Streaming Pattern**: Using Server-Sent Events with IAsyncEnumerable for real-time responses
- **Authentication Approach**: Implementing JWT authentication with 30-day token lifetime
- **Validation Strategy**: Using FluentValidation with specialized validators for each request type
- **Exception Handling**: Implementing controller-level try/catch with HTTP status code mapping
- **Repository Pattern**: Using shared repositories from Ollama_DB_layer for data access

## Current Status

### Working Components
- Gateway service with Ocelot routing and authentication
- Conversation management with real-time chat capabilities
- Authentication with JWT tokens and refresh functionality
- Administrative tools for platform management
- Model exploration and discovery
- Redis-based caching across services
- Database integration via shared Ollama_DB_layer

### Known Issues
- Search functionality in ConversationService is limited (returns regular pagination)
- Caching strategy may need optimization for large conversation datasets
- No comprehensive error handling for Redis connection failures
- Background processing for streaming operations uses Task.Run without proper monitoring
- Missing rate limiting on some endpoints could lead to potential abuse
- Limited audit trail for security-sensitive operations

## Next Steps

### Short-Term Priorities
1. Enhance search functionality in ConversationService with proper database-level search
2. Optimize caching strategy for conversation history with size-based limits
3. Implement rate limiting across all services
4. Improve error handling for external service failures
5. Add monitoring for background processing tasks

### Medium-Term Goals
1. Develop comprehensive integration testing approach
2. Implement conversation archiving for older conversations
3. Enhance audit logging for security-sensitive operations
4. Optimize database query performance for large datasets
5. Implement health checks and monitoring across all services

### Long-Term Vision
1. Implement clustering and load balancing for high availability
2. Develop advanced analytics for platform usage
3. Enhance security with refresh token rotation
4. Add multi-model conversation capabilities
5. Implement AI model performance tracking and optimization

## Open Questions

1. What is the optimal approach for implementing full-text search for conversations?
2. How should conversation history be pruned or archived for long-running conversations?
3. What metrics should be collected for monitoring service performance?
4. How should streaming response performance be optimized for high-concurrency scenarios?
5. What rate limiting strategy would be most effective for chat endpoints?
