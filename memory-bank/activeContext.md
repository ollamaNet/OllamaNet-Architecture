## Current Focus

We are currently implementing and optimizing Redis caching across the microservices architecture:

1. **ExploreService Caching**: Completed implementation of robust caching with proper error handling and logging
2. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive guide for implementing consistent caching in other services
3. **Memory Bank Updates**: Updated technical documentation with caching patterns and strategies

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced ExploreService with Redis caching for performance optimization
- Implemented specialized exception handling for cache operations with graceful fallbacks
- Created structured logging strategy for cache operations and failures
- Simplified service code while maintaining robust error handling

## Active Decisions

### Caching Strategy

- **Approach**: Cache-aside pattern with explicit TTL and invalidation
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to database when cache is unavailable
- **Duration**: Service-specific expiration times based on data volatility
- **Exception Handling**: Convert low-level cache exceptions to service-appropriate types

### Performance Considerations

- Cache hit/miss ratios should be monitored
- Strategic caching for high-traffic endpoints
- Careful timeout configuration to prevent slow responses
