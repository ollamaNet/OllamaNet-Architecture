# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a microservices architecture with the following key components:

### Service Architecture
1. Gateway Service
   - Entry point for all external requests
   - Handles routing and load balancing
   - Implements API gateway pattern

2. Auth Service
   - Implements authentication and authorization
   - Follows security best practices
   - Manages user sessions and tokens

3. Explore Service
   - [Architecture details to be defined]

4. Ollama Component
   - Implements adapter pattern for Ollama integration
   - Handles model management and inference
   - Manages API communication
