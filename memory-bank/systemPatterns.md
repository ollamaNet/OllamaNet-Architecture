# System Architecture Patterns

## Microservices Architecture

### Service Components
1. **API Gateway**
   - Entry point for all client requests
   - Routes requests to appropriate services
   - Handles authentication and authorization

2. **Authentication Service**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - JWT token management
   - User profile management

3. **Chat Services**
   - Real-time chat processing
   - Conversation management
   - Message handling
   - Synchronous communication with LLM Inference Service

4. **Explore Service**
   - Model discovery and search
   - Available models listing
   - Synchronous communication with LLM Inference Service

5. **Admin Services**
   - System administration
   - Audit logging
   - Background task management
   - Asynchronous communication with LLM Inference Service

6. **LLM Inference Service**
   - Hosts and manages LLMs
   - Handles model inference requests
   - Model lifecycle management

### Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous Communication
- Real-time chat operations
- Authentication requests
- Model discovery and search
- User profile operations
- Direct API calls between services

#### Asynchronous Communication (Message Queue)
- Model installation/deletion
- System configuration updates
- Audit logging
- Background tasks
- Cross-service notifications
- Usage statistics collection

### Infrastructure Components
1. **Service Registry**
   - Service discovery
   - Load balancing
   - Health monitoring

2. **Config Server**
   - Centralized configuration
   - Environment-specific settings

3. **Message Queue**
   - Asynchronous communication
   - Task queuing
   - Event distribution

4. **Distributed Cache**
   - Performance optimization
   - Session management
   - Data caching

5. **Monitoring**
   - System health monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Logging and tracing

### Database Architecture
- **Shared Database Approach**
  - Single database instance for all services
  - Unified data access layer
  - Shared schema for common entities
  - Service-specific schemas where needed
  - Centralized data consistency
  - Simplified transaction management
  - Reduced operational complexity

### Database Dependencies
- All Services → Shared Database
  - Authentication Service
  - Chat Services
  - Explore Service
  - Admin Services
  - LLM Inference Service

## Design Patterns in Use

1. **API Gateway Pattern**
   - Single entry point
   - Request routing
   - Authentication/Authorization

2. **Service Discovery Pattern**
   - Dynamic service registration
   - Load balancing
   - Health checks

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Fault tolerance
   - Service resilience
   - Graceful degradation

4. **CQRS Pattern**
   - Separate read/write models
   - Optimized queries
   - Event sourcing

5. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Asynchronous communication
   - Loose coupling
   - Scalability

## Component Relationships

### Direct Dependencies
- API Gateway → Authentication Service
- API Gateway → Chat Services
- API Gateway → Explore Service
- API Gateway → Admin Services
- Chat Services → LLM Inference Service
- Explore Service → LLM Inference Service

### Message Queue Dependencies
- Admin Services → Message Queue
- Background Tasks → Message Queue
- Audit Service → Message Queue
- Model Management → Message Queue
