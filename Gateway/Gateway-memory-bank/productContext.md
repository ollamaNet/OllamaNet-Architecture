# Gateway Product Context

## Purpose
The Gateway serves as the entry point to the OllamaNet ecosystem, allowing clients to access various services through a unified interface. It simplifies client development by providing a single point of access and consistent API patterns.

## User Experience
- Developers interact with a single API endpoint for all services
- Authentication is handled consistently across services
- API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- Responses maintain consistent structure

## Problem Space
The Gateway solves several key problems:
- **Service Discovery**: Clients don't need to know the location of each service
- **Authentication**: Centralized authentication and authorization
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Rate limiting, logging, and monitoring
- **Configuration Management**: Simplifies service configuration

## Product Goals
- Provide reliable routing to all microservices
- Ensure high performance with minimal latency overhead
- Support seamless updates to service configurations
- Offer robust monitoring and diagnostics
- Enable secure access to services

## Target Audience
- Frontend developers consuming the API
- Mobile app developers
- System administrators managing the gateway
- DevOps engineers deploying and monitoring the system

## Key Workflows

### End User Workflows
1. **Authentication**
   - User authenticates through the gateway
   - Gateway routes to authentication service
   - JWT token is issued and used for subsequent requests

2. **Service Access**
   - User makes request to specific service endpoint
   - Gateway validates authentication
   - Request is routed to appropriate service
   - Response is returned to user

### Administrator Workflows
1. **Configuration Management**
   - Update service configuration files
   - Gateway detects changes automatically
   - New configuration is loaded and validated
   - Changes are applied without service restart

2. **Monitoring**
   - View gateway performance metrics
   - Check route health and status
   - Track service usage patterns

## Integration Context
The Gateway integrates with:
- **Authentication Service**: For user authentication and authorization
- **Administration Service**: For system administration functions
- **Exploration Service**: For browsing available models and resources
- **Conversation Service**: For interacting with AI models

## Future Directions
- Configuration dashboard for visual configuration management
- Expanded monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Enhanced caching for improved performance
- Traffic shaping and rate limiting enhancements
- Support for WebSockets and other communication protocols
