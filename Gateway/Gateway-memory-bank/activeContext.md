# Gateway Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing a modular configuration system for the Ocelot API Gateway. This involves:
1. Splitting the monolithic configuration into service-specific files
2. Implementing variable-based configuration for service URLs
3. Creating a configuration loader that combines the separate files
4. Setting up file watching for automatic reloading
5. Planning for a configuration dashboard

## Recent Changes

### Configuration Splitting
- Created directory structure for configuration files
- Split configuration by service (Auth, Admin, Explore, Conversation)
- Implemented ServiceUrls.json for centralized URL management
- Created Global.json for global Ocelot settings

### Configuration Loading
- Implemented ConfigurationLoader class
- Added variable replacement functionality
- Updated Program.cs to use the new configuration loader
- Added configuration file watching

## Current State
- The basic configuration splitting is implemented
- Variable substitution is working correctly
- File watching is implemented but needs testing
- Combined configuration is generated at runtime

## Decisions in Progress

### Configuration Dashboard
- Planning a web-based dashboard for configuration management
- Considering various UI approaches (React, Angular, or Razor Pages)
- Evaluating security requirements for the dashboard
- Determining how to implement versioning and rollback

### Environment-Specific Configuration
- Considering how to handle different environments (Development, Production)
- Evaluating approaches for environment detection
- Planning for secure storage of production configurations

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. Test and validate the current configuration splitting implementation
2. Implement proper error handling for configuration loading
3. Enhance logging for configuration changes
4. Document the new configuration approach

### Medium-term Tasks
1. Begin implementation of the configuration dashboard
2. Add configuration validation
3. Set up automated tests for configuration functionality
4. Implement environment-specific configuration support

### Long-term Goals
1. Complete the configuration dashboard
2. Implement versioning and rollback for configurations
3. Add monitoring and alerting for configuration issues
4. Enhance performance of the API gateway
