# Gateway Context Diagram Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the necessary files to review and steps to take before creating a Context Diagram for the Gateway project in PlantUML format. A Context Diagram will show the Gateway system as a whole and its interactions with external systems, users, and services.

## Files to Review

### Core Memory Bank Files
1. **projectbrief.md** - To understand the core purpose and requirements of the Gateway
2. **productContext.md** - To identify all external systems and user types that interact with the Gateway
3. **systemPatterns.md** - To understand the architectural patterns and system boundaries
4. **techContext.md** - To identify technical dependencies and integration points

### Implementation Files
1. **Program.cs** - To understand the startup configuration and service registration
2. **ServiceExtensions.cs** - To identify service dependencies and external connections
3. **Configurations/*.json** - To understand the routing configuration and service endpoints
   - ServiceUrls.json
   - Global.json
   - Auth.json
   - Admin.json
   - Explore.json
   - Conversation.json
   - RoleAuthorization.json
4. **Middlewares/** - To identify cross-cutting concerns and external system interactions
   - Particularly middleware that interacts with external systems

### Existing Plans and Documentation
1. **plans/OcelotConfigPlan.md** - To understand the configuration structure
2. **plans/ConfigDashboardPlan.md** - To understand the dashboard integration

## Context Elements to Identify

1. **External Users**
   - End users accessing services through the Gateway
   - Administrators managing the Gateway
   - DevOps engineers monitoring the system

2. **External Systems**
   - Authentication Service
   - Administration Service
   - Exploration Service
   - Conversation Service
   - Any monitoring or logging systems
   - Configuration management systems

3. **Data Flows**
   - Authentication flows
   - Service request/response flows
   - Configuration update flows
   - Monitoring data flows

## Diagram Planning

### Context Diagram Structure
```
[External User] --> [Gateway System] --> [Microservices]
[Administrator] --> [Gateway System] <-- [Monitoring Systems]
```

### PlantUML Considerations
- Use `rectangle` or `component` for the Gateway system
- Use `actor` for user types
- Use `cloud` or `component` for external systems
- Use arrows to show data flow directions
- Include brief descriptions of key interactions
- Use color coding to distinguish different types of systems

## Next Steps

1. Review all identified files to gather context information
2. Identify all external actors and systems
3. Map data flows between the Gateway and external entities
4. Create a draft Context Diagram in PlantUML
5. Review and refine the diagram
6. Document the diagram with explanations of key interactions

## Implementation Timeline
- File review: 1 day
- Context element identification: 1 day
- Initial diagram creation: 1 day
- Review and refinement: 1 day

Total estimated time: 4 days
