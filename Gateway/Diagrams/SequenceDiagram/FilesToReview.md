# Files to Review Before Implementing the Gateway Sequence Diagram

Before implementing the Gateway Sequence Diagram that focuses on the authentication and authorization flow, the following files should be reviewed to understand the complete flow and interactions between components:

## Core Authentication and Authorization Files

1. **Gateway/ServiceExtenstions.cs**
   - Contains JWT authentication setup and configuration
   - Defines authorization policies for Admin and User roles
   - Configures CORS settings
   - Sets up role-based authorization middleware

2. **Gateway/Middlewares/RoleAuthorizationMiddleware.cs**
   - Implements role-based authorization checks
   - Validates user roles against required roles for endpoints
   - Returns 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden responses when appropriate

3. **Gateway/Middlewares/ClaimsToHeaderMiddleware.cs**
   - Extracts user claims from authenticated requests
   - Forwards claims as headers to downstream services
   - Includes user ID, email, and roles

4. **Gateway/Program.cs**
   - Shows middleware pipeline order and configuration
   - Demonstrates how authentication, authorization, and claims forwarding are integrated
   - Shows the order of middleware execution

## Configuration Files

5. **Gateway/Configurations/RoleAuthorization.json**
   - Maps endpoints to required roles
   - Defines which roles can access specific API endpoints

6. **Gateway/Configurations/Auth.json**
   - Contains routes for authentication endpoints
   - Defines how authentication requests are routed to the Auth service

7. **Gateway/Configurations/ServiceUrls.json**
   - Contains service endpoints configuration
   - Defines host, port, and scheme for each service

8. **Gateway/Configurations/Global.json**
   - Global gateway configuration
   - Defines base URL for the gateway

## Configuration Loading

9. **Gateway/Services/ConfigurationLoader/ConfigurationLoader.cs**
   - Loads and combines configurations from multiple files
   - Handles variable replacement in configuration
   - Creates the combined Ocelot configuration

## AuthService Files

10. **AuthService/Helpers/JWT.cs**
    - JWT configuration model
    - Defines key, issuer, audience, and token duration

11. **AuthService/Helpers/JWTManager.cs**
    - JWT token generation and validation
    - Creates JWT tokens with appropriate claims
    - Validates incoming tokens

## Understanding These Files Will Help With:

1. **Authentication Flow**: How JWT tokens are validated and processed
2. **Authorization Logic**: How role-based access control is implemented
3. **Claims Forwarding**: How user identity is passed to downstream services
4. **Request Routing**: How requests are directed to appropriate services
5. **Configuration Management**: How service routes and authorization rules are configured

Reviewing these files will provide a comprehensive understanding of the authentication and authorization flow, which is essential for creating an accurate and detailed sequence diagram.
