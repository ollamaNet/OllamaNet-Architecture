# Gateway Sequence Diagram Plan

## Focus Area
The Sequence Diagram will document the authentication and authorization flow, showing how a user request flows through JWT authentication, role authorization middleware, claims forwarding, and finally to the appropriate service.

## Key Participants
1. **End User**: Initiates requests with JWT token
2. **Gateway API**: Entry point for all requests
3. **JWT Authentication**: Validates the token
4. **Role Authorization Middleware**: Checks user roles against required roles
5. **Claims Forwarding Middleware**: Extracts and forwards user claims
6. **Authentication Service**: Handles login/registration (for reference)
7. **Target Service**: Processes the authenticated request

## Main Sequence Steps
The diagram will document the following main sequence:

1. User sends request with JWT token
2. Gateway validates JWT token
3. Role Authorization Middleware checks user roles against required roles for the endpoint
4. If authorized, Claims Forwarding Middleware extracts and adds user claims as headers
5. Request is routed to the appropriate service
6. Service processes the request and returns response
7. Gateway returns response to user

## Alternative Paths
The diagram will include the following alternative paths:

1. JWT validation failure
2. Role authorization failure
3. Service unavailability
4. Service error response

## Implementation Files
The sequence diagram will be implemented in the following files:

1. `AuthorizationSequence.puml` - PlantUML file with the sequence diagram
2. `AuthorizationSequenceDocumentation.md` - Documentation explaining the diagram
3. `AuthorizationSequenceMermaid.md` - Mermaid version of the diagram

All files will be placed in the `Gateway/Diagrams/SequenceDiagram` folder.

## Files to Review
Before implementing the sequence diagram, several files need to be reviewed to understand the complete authentication and authorization flow. See the [Files to Review](FilesToReview.md) document for a comprehensive list.

## Implementation Approach
1. Create the basic sequence flow with all participants
2. Add detailed interactions for the happy path
3. Add alternative paths for error scenarios
4. Add notes and explanations
5. Create documentation with analysis
6. Create Mermaid version for simpler visualization

## Next Steps
1. Review the files listed in the [Files to Review](FilesToReview.md) document
2. Create the PlantUML sequence diagram
3. Document the diagram with explanations
4. Create the Mermaid version
5. Update the documentation with insights and analysis
