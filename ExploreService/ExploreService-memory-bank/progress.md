# Progress Tracking for ExploreService

## Completed Components
- Core API controller (ExploreController) with four endpoints:
  - GET /api/v1/explore/models (paginated)
  - GET /api/v1/explore/models/{id}
  - GET /api/v1/explore/tags
  - GET /api/v1/explore/tags/{tagId}/models
- IExploreService interface and implementation
- Two-tier caching architecture:
  - ICacheManager and implementation
  - IRedisCacheService and implementation
  - CacheKeys for consistent cache key generation
- Custom exception framework:
  - Domain exceptions (ExploreServiceException hierarchy)
  - Infrastructure exceptions (CacheException hierarchy)
- DTO mapper implementation:
  - ModelMapper for AIModel → ModelInfoResponse conversion
  - TagMapper for Tag → GetTagsResponse conversion
- Comprehensive logging throughout the service
- Swagger documentation setup
- Entity Framework Core integration via repositories
- Memory bank documentation completion

## Working Functionality
- Model listing with pagination
- Model details by ID
- Tag listing
- Models by tag filtering
- Sophisticated Redis caching with:
  - Automatic fallback to database on cache failures
  - Configurable expiration times per data type
  - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Timeout handling for cache operations
- Exception handling with specific error responses
- Swagger UI for API testing

## In Progress
- Cache invalidation strategy implementation
- ClearCache method completion (currently throws NotImplementedException)

## Pending Work
- Search functionality (CacheKeys.SearchResults exists but no controller endpoint)
- Comprehensive testing of all endpoints
- Performance testing under high load
- Integration testing with frontend clients
- Monitoring and telemetry implementation
- Safe implementation of cache clearing functionality

## Known Issues
- Cache invalidation strategy not fully implemented
- ClearCache method in CacheManager throws NotImplementedException
- Potential performance bottlenecks under high load (needs testing)
- No search endpoint implemented despite having cache key defined

## Performance Metrics
- API response times to be measured (Stopwatch implemented for tracking)
- Cache hit rates can be derived from logs (cache hits/misses are logged)
- Database query performance to be evaluated
- Redis operation timeouts configured but need monitoring

## Recent Milestones
- Memory bank documentation completed
- Full code review completed
- Identification of specific areas for improvement

## Next Milestones
- Implementation of cache invalidation strategy
- Completion of ClearCache functionality
- Addition of search functionality
- Performance testing and optimization
