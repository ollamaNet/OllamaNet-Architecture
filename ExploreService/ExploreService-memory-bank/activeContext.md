# Active Context for ExploreService

## Current Focus
- Completed the memory bank documentation for ExploreService
- Understanding the implementation details of the caching strategy
- Analyzing the exception handling patterns in the service

## Recent Changes
- Memory bank documentation fully updated with implementation details
- Documentation of core components, architecture, and design patterns enhanced
- Caching and exception handling patterns documented

## Current Status
- ExploreService is fully implemented with four core endpoints:
  - GET /api/v1/explore/models - Paginated list of models
  - GET /api/v1/explore/models/{id} - Detailed model information
  - GET /api/v1/explore/tags - List of all available tags
  - GET /api/v1/explore/tags/{tagId}/models - Models filtered by tag
- Sophisticated Redis caching implemented with:
  - Two-tier caching architecture (CacheManager and RedisCacheService)
  - Graceful fallback on cache failures
  - Configurable timeouts and retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive exception handling with domain-specific exceptions
- Clean separation of data model using mapper pattern

## Active Decisions
- Two-tier caching approach provides resilience and performance
- Specific caching timeouts per data type (models, tags, etc.)
- Structured exception handling pattern with domain exceptions
- Entity to DTO mapping using static mapper classes

## Next Steps
- Review cache invalidation strategy (currently marked as an issue in progress.md)
- Implement the ClearCache method in CacheManager (currently throws NotImplementedException)
- Consider adding search functionality (endpoint exists in CacheKeys but not in controller)
- Performance testing of caching layer with high load
- Integration testing with frontend clients

## Open Questions
- What is the strategy for cache invalidation when model data changes?
- How should the ClearCache functionality be implemented safely?
- What are the specific performance requirements for high-load scenarios?
- Are there any monitoring tools to be integrated for cache performance tracking?

## Current Context
The ExploreService provides API endpoints for discovering and exploring AI models in the OllamaNet platform. It leverages a sophisticated Redis caching implementation for performance and resilience, with comprehensive error handling. The service follows a clean architecture pattern with controllers, services, repositories, and mappers.
