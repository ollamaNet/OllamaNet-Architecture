# Project Brief: Spicy Avocado

## Overview
Spicy Avocado enables users to deploy and expose Ollama models from cloud code editors (such as Google Colab, Kaggle, Datadog, and similar platforms) as a public API endpoint using ngrok. The project allows users to run LLM models in notebook environments and make them accessible to remote clients and applications.

## Core Requirements

1. **Ollama Integration**: Install and run Ollama to serve local LLM models.
2. **Model Deployment**: Pull and serve specific Ollama models (currently configured for llama3.2:1b).
3. **Public Accessibility**: Use ngrok to create a secure tunnel and expose the Ollama API to the internet.
4. **Environment Configuration**: Set up proper environment variables for Ollama and ngrok.

## Goals

- Provide a simple way to deploy and access Ollama models
- Create a reliable public API endpoint for the models
- Ensure proper configuration and error handling
- Enable easy setup and deployment across different environments

## Scope

### In Scope
- Ollama installation and configuration
- Model pulling and serving
- ngrok tunnel setup
- Basic error handling and logging

### Out of Scope
- Advanced security features
- User authentication and authorization
- Custom model training
- Web UI for model interaction (currently API-only)

## Success Criteria
- Successfully install and run Ollama
- Successfully pull and serve the specified model
- Generate a valid public URL through ngrok
- Verify API accessibility through the public URL
