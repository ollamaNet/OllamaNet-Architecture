# Progress: Spicy Avocado

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- ✅ **Ollama Installation**: The system can install Ollama using the installation script
- ✅ **Model Pulling**: The specified Ollama model (llama3.2:1b) can be pulled successfully
- ✅ **Ollama Server**: The Ollama server can be started with proper configuration
- ✅ **ngrok Installation**: ngrok can be installed and configured with the auth token
- ✅ **Tunnel Creation**: A secure tunnel can be created to expose the Ollama API
- ✅ **Public URL Retrieval**: The system can retrieve and display the public URL
- ✅ **RabbitMQ URL Publishing**: The system can publish the Ollama API URL to RabbitMQ

### Supporting Features

- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Environment variables are properly set for both services
- ✅ **Process Management**: External processes are properly managed using subprocess
- ✅ **Basic Error Handling**: The system checks for successful startup and reports errors
- ✅ **Logging**: Basic logging to files is implemented

### RabbitMQ Integration

- ✅ **Connection Establishment**: The system can establish a connection to RabbitMQ
- ✅ **Exchange Declaration**: The system can declare an exchange in RabbitMQ
- ✅ **Message Publishing**: The system can publish messages to RabbitMQ
- ✅ **Error Handling**: The system handles errors during RabbitMQ operations
- ✅ **Connection Cleanup**: The system can clean up RabbitMQ connections

## What's Left to Build

### Enhancements

- ❌ **Configuration File**: Move configuration to a separate file instead of hardcoded values
- ❌ **Improved Error Handling**: More robust error detection and recovery
- ❌ **Service Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of service health
- ❌ **Automatic Reconnection**: Automatically reestablish the tunnel if it goes down
- ❌ **Complete Notebook Refactor**: Apply planned restructuring and ensure all cells execute successfully

### New Features

- ❌ **Multiple Model Support**: Ability to switch between different models
- ❌ **API Authentication**: Add security to the exposed API
- ❌ **Web UI**: Simple web interface for interacting with the model
- ❌ **Containerization**: Docker configuration for easier deployment
- ❌ **FastAPI Microservice**: Build FastAPI-based `avocado-infer` inference microservice

### RabbitMQ Enhancements

- ❌ **Retry Logic for Failed Publishes**: Implement retry logic for failed publishes
- ❌ **Periodic URL Updates**: Implement periodic URL updates
- ❌ **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling
- ❌ **Message Persistence**: Implement message persistence

### Security Improvements

- ❌ **Move Credentials to Environment Variables**: Move credentials to environment variables
- ❌ **Implement Credential Rotation**: Implement credential rotation
- ❌ **Add Connection Encryption**: Add connection encryption

### Monitoring

- ❌ **Message Delivery Tracking**: Implement message delivery tracking
- ❌ **Connection Health Monitoring**: Implement connection health monitoring
- ❌ **Error Rate Monitoring**: Implement error rate monitoring
- ❌ **Performance Metrics**: Implement performance metrics

## Current Status

**Status**: Functional Prototype

The current implementation is a functional prototype that successfully demonstrates the core concept in notebook/cloud code editor environments. It can install and configure both Ollama and ngrok, pull the specified model, start the services, and expose the API through a public URL for remote consumption.

The implementation is notebook-first, designed for platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle, and Datadog. Each cell in the notebook represents a specific step in the process, making it easy to execute and modify for different cloud environments.

**RabbitMQ Integration**:
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Stability**: Good
- **Reliability**: High
- **Error Handling**: Effective

**Service Discovery**:
- **Status**: Working
- **URL Updates**: On-demand
- **Message Format**: Standardized
- **Routing**: Configured

## Known Issues

1. **Hard-coded Configuration**
   - Issue: Configuration values like model ID and auth tokens are hard-coded in the notebook
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to change configuration without modifying code
   - Potential solution: Move to environment variables or config file

2. **No Authentication**
   - Issue: The exposed API has no authentication
   - Impact: Anyone with the URL can access the API
   - Potential solution: Implement API key or other authentication mechanism

3. **Tunnel Stability**
   - Issue: ngrok tunnels may disconnect after some time
   - Impact: Service becomes unavailable until manually restarted
   - Potential solution: Implement automatic reconnection and health checks

4. **Process Cleanup**
   - Issue: No proper cleanup of processes on notebook shutdown
   - Impact: Processes may continue running after notebook is closed
   - Potential solution: Implement proper shutdown hooks

5. **Limited Error Recovery**
   - Issue: Limited ability to recover from errors
   - Impact: Manual intervention required for many error conditions
   - Potential solution: Implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

6. **RabbitMQ**
   - **No retry mechanism for failed publishes**: Implement retry logic for failed publishes
   - **Credentials in configuration**: Move credentials to environment variables
   - **No periodic URL updates**: Implement periodic URL updates
   - **No connection pooling**: Implement connection pooling

7. **General**
   - **ngrok URL changes on restart**: Implement automatic reconnection
   - **No message persistence**: Implement message persistence
   - **Limited error recovery**: Implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
