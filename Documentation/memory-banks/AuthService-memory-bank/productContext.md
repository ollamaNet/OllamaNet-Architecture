- **Session Management**: Maintains user sessions across the distributed system with secure token handling
- **Administrative Control**: Provides admin capabilities for user role management

## User Experience Goals
- Seamless authentication process with minimal friction
- Secure password management workflows
- Persistent sessions using refresh tokens
- Clear role-based access indicators
- Easy profile management

## Target Users
- End users of the OllamaNet platform requiring secure accounts
- Administrators managing user access and roles
- Developers integrating authentication into other platform services

## Business Value
- Centralized authentication reduces duplication across services
- Enhanced security through proper JWT implementation and refresh tokens
- Simplified user management for administrators
- Streamlined onboarding process for new users
- Compliance with security best practices

## Success Metrics
- User registration and retention rates
- Authentication success rates
- Password reset completion rates
- Admin role management effectiveness
- Security incident reduction
- API response times for authentication operations

## User Journeys
1. **New User Registration**: User registers → receives automatic role assignment → gets root folder created → receives JWT token for platform access
2. **Returning User Login**: User logs in → receives JWT and refresh tokens → accesses platform services
3. **Password Management**: User initiates password reset → receives reset token → sets new password → regains access
4. **Profile Management**: User updates profile information → continues using platform with updated details
5. **Admin User Management**: Admin assigns/removes roles → affected users receive updated access privileges
