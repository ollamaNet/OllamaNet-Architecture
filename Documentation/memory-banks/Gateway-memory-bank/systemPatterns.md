# Gateway System Patterns

## Architecture Patterns

### API Gateway Pattern
The Gateway implements the API Gateway pattern, providing a single entry point for clients to access multiple microservices. This simplifies client-side code and provides a unified interface.

### Configuration-as-Code
Configuration is treated as code with the following principles:
- Version controlled
- Segregated by service
- Validated for correctness
- Loaded dynamically

### Variable Substitution Pattern
Service URLs and other common values are defined once and referenced throughout the configuration:
- Central definition in ServiceUrls.json
- References using ${variable} syntax
- Resolved at runtime

### Observer Pattern
File system changes are monitored using the Observer pattern:
- ConfigurationChangeMonitor watches for file changes
- Changes trigger configuration reload
- Subscribers are notified of configuration updates

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
The ConfigurationLoader implements a factory pattern to create configuration objects:
- Combines multiple configuration sources
- Produces a single unified configuration
- Handles variable substitution

### Decorator Pattern
Authentication and authorization are implemented as decorators:
- JWT validation decorates incoming requests
- ClaimsToHeaderMiddleware decorates requests to downstream services

### Strategy Pattern
Different services have different routing strategies:
- Some routes require authentication
- Some routes support different HTTP methods
- Strategies are defined in configuration

## Code Organization

### Service-Oriented Organization
Configuration is organized by service:
- Auth.json for authentication routes
- Admin.json for administration routes
- Explore.json for exploration routes
- Conversation.json for conversation routes

### Separation of Concerns
The codebase is organized with clear separation:
- Configuration loading (ConfigurationLoader)
- Configuration watching (ConfigurationChangeMonitor)
- Request handling (Ocelot middleware)
- Authentication (JWT middleware)

## Extension Points

### Custom Middleware
The system supports custom middleware for request/response processing:
- ClaimsToHeaderMiddleware for forwarding user claims to downstream services
- RoleAuthorizationMiddleware for enforcing role-based access control
- Future middleware for logging, caching, rate limiting, etc.

### Configuration Processors
The configuration system can be extended with custom processors:
- Variable replacement (implemented in ConfigurationLoader)
- Environment-specific configurations (planned)
- Configuration validation (planned)
- Configuration versioning and rollback (planned)

### Dashboard Integration
The planned configuration dashboard will provide extension points for:
- Custom validation rules
- Configuration templates
- Import/export functionality
- Environment promotion workflows
