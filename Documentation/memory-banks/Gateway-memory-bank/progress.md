## Known Issues

1. **Hot Reload Limitations**: Configuration changes require application restart to fully apply
2. **Error Handling**: Need more robust error handling for malformed configurations
3. **Logging**: Configuration changes should be logged more extensively
4. **Security**: The configuration files need additional security measures
5. **Role Authorization Testing**: Comprehensive testing needed for role-based access control
6. **Claims Forwarding**: Need to verify all necessary claims are forwarded correctly
7. **Configuration Validation**: No validation for configuration files before loading

## Metrics
- **Routes Migrated**: 46/46 (100%)
- **Services Configured**: 4/4 (100%)
- **Variables Implemented**: All service URLs
- **Test Coverage**: ~60% (estimated)
- **New Routes Added**: 13 (6 Folder + 7 Note controller routes)
