# Gateway Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on testing and validating the modular configuration system for the Ocelot API Gateway, and documenting the implementation. This involves:
1. Testing the split configuration files (Auth, Admin, Explore, Conversation)
2. Validating variable replacement functionality
3. Testing configuration file watching and reloading
4. Verifying role-based authorization with RoleAuthorization.json
5. Testing claims forwarding to downstream services
6. Documenting the configuration approach
7. Planning for a configuration dashboard

## Recent Changes

### Configuration Splitting
- Created directory structure for configuration files
- Split configuration by service (Auth, Admin, Explore, Conversation)
- Implemented ServiceUrls.json for centralized URL management
- Created Global.json for global Ocelot settings

### Configuration Loading
- Implemented ConfigurationLoader class
- Added variable replacement functionality
- Updated Program.cs to use the new configuration loader
- Added configuration file watching

### Recent Route Additions
- Added Folder Controller routes to Conversation.json
  - Implemented all CRUD operations
  - Added soft delete functionality
  - Used consistent path structure (/Folder/*)
- Added Note Controller routes to Conversation.json
  - Implemented all CRUD operations
  - Added specialized endpoints (soft-delete, by-response, by-conversation)
  - Used consistent path structure (/notes/*)

## Current State
- The basic configuration splitting is implemented
- Variable substitution is working correctly
- File watching is implemented but needs testing
- Combined configuration is generated at runtime
- All Conversation service controllers are now properly routed

## Decisions in Progress

### Configuration Dashboard
- Planning a web-based dashboard for configuration management
- Considering various UI approaches (React, Angular, or Razor Pages)
- Evaluating security requirements for the dashboard
- Determining how to implement versioning and rollback

### Environment-Specific Configuration
- Considering how to handle different environments (Development, Production)
- Evaluating approaches for environment detection
- Planning for secure storage of production configurations

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. Complete testing of all routes and configuration reloading
2. Verify role-based authorization with different user roles
3. Test claims forwarding to downstream services
4. Enhance error handling for configuration loading
5. Improve logging for configuration changes
6. Complete documentation of the configuration approach
7. Create diagrams for configuration flow and authorization

### Medium-term Tasks
1. Begin implementation of the configuration dashboard
2. Add configuration validation
3. Set up automated tests for configuration functionality
4. Implement environment-specific configuration support

### Long-term Goals
1. Complete the configuration dashboard
2. Implement versioning and rollback for configurations
3. Add monitoring and alerting for configuration issues
4. Enhance performance of the API gateway
