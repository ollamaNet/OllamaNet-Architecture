# Active Context: Ollama DB Layer

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the Ollama DB Layer project appears to be establishing a robust data access foundation for the Ollama AI application. Based on the codebase examination, the project has implemented:

1. **Entity Framework Core Integration**: The database context and entity configurations are set up.

2. **Repository Pattern Implementation**: Repositories for all major entities have been created.

3. **Unit of Work Pattern**: A UnitOfWork class coordinates operations across repositories.

4. **Identity Integration**: ASP.NET Identity has been extended with custom user properties.

5. **Entity Relationships**: Relationships between entities like Users, AI Models, and Conversations are defined.

## Recent Changes

Based on the migration files and code structure, recent changes appear to include:

1. **Attachment Support**: Added support for file attachments in conversations (Migration: 20250421175318_AddAttachments).

2. **Conversation Titles**: Added title field to conversations (Migration: 20250420215857_ConvTitle).

3. **User Activity Tracking**: Added IsActive attribute to track user status (Migration: 20250513110748_IsAtciveAttribute).

4. **Token Version for Users**: Added TokenVersion to ApplicationUser for refresh token validation (Migration: 20250318204559_TokenVersion_ApplicationUser).

5. **Soft Delete Implementation**: Added IsDeleted flags to entities for logical deletion (Migration: 20250318192848_ISDeleted_Attribute).

## Next Steps

Potential next steps for the project could include:

1. **Repository Unit Testing**: Implementing comprehensive unit tests for repositories and the Unit of Work.

2. **Query Optimization**: Reviewing and optimizing database queries for performance.

3. **Documentation**: Enhancing code documentation and creating API documentation.

4. **Advanced Repository Features**: Adding more specialized query methods to repositories for common use cases.

5. **Caching Strategy**: Implementing caching for frequently accessed data.

6. **Audit Logging**: Adding audit logging for data changes.

7. **Data Validation**: Enhancing validation rules for entities.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Repository Granularity**: The project uses fine-grained repositories for each entity type, which provides good separation of concerns but requires more code.

2. **Soft Delete vs. Hard Delete**: The system implements both soft delete and hard delete options, with soft delete being the preferred approach for most entities.

3. **Identity Extension**: The decision to extend ASP.NET Identity with custom properties rather than creating separate user-related tables.

### Technical Considerations

1. **Migration Strategy**: How to handle database migrations in production environments.

2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implementing tools or patterns to monitor query performance.

3. **Connection Management**: Ensuring efficient database connection usage, especially under load.

4. **Transaction Scope**: Determining appropriate transaction boundaries for different operations.

### Integration Considerations

1. **API Layer Integration**: How the DB Layer will be consumed by API controllers or services.

2. **Authentication Flow**: How the extended Identity system will be used in authentication flows.

3. **Business Logic Separation**: Ensuring business logic remains separate from data access concerns.

The Ollama DB Layer is well-structured and follows established patterns for data access. Future work should focus on enhancing its capabilities while maintaining the clean architecture already established.
