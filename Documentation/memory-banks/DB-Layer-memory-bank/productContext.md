# Product Context: Ollama DB Layer

## Why This Project Exists

The Ollama DB Layer exists to provide a structured, maintainable, and efficient data access layer for the Ollama AI application ecosystem. It serves as the bridge between the application's business logic and the underlying database, ensuring consistent data operations and proper separation of concerns.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Data Access Complexity**: Simplifies database interactions by abstracting away the complexities of direct database queries and operations.

2. **Code Duplication**: Eliminates the need to write repetitive data access code across different parts of the application by centralizing data operations in repositories.

3. **Transaction Management**: Provides a Unit of Work pattern to manage transactions across multiple repositories, ensuring data consistency.

4. **Entity Relationships**: Manages complex relationships between entities such as Users, AI Models, Conversations, and Responses.

5. **User Management**: Integrates with ASP.NET Identity to handle user authentication, authorization, and profile management.

6. **Data Integrity**: Implements soft delete functionality and validation to maintain data integrity.

## How It Should Work

The Ollama DB Layer should function as a clean, well-defined API for data operations:

1. **Repository Access**: Application services should access data exclusively through repository interfaces, never directly through the database context.

2. **Transaction Coordination**: The Unit of Work should coordinate operations across multiple repositories, ensuring that changes are committed atomically.

3. **Entity Lifecycle Management**: Repositories should handle the complete lifecycle of entities, including creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion (both hard and soft).

4. **Query Optimization**: Repositories should provide optimized query methods for common data access patterns.

5. **Identity Integration**: User management should leverage ASP.NET Identity while extending it with application-specific functionality.

## User Experience Goals

While the DB Layer itself doesn't directly interact with end users, it significantly impacts the user experience by enabling:

1. **Performance**: Fast data access and efficient queries for responsive application behavior.

2. **Reliability**: Consistent data operations that maintain integrity and prevent data corruption.

3. **Personalization**: Proper user data management to support personalized experiences.

4. **History and Context**: Efficient storage and retrieval of conversation history and AI interactions.

5. **Security**: Protection of user data and proper access controls.

The Ollama DB Layer is a critical foundation that enables the application to deliver a seamless, reliable, and personalized AI interaction experience to end users.
