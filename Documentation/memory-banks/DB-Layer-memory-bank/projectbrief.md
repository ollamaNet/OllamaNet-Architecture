# Project Brief: Ollama DB Layer

## Overview
Ollama DB Layer is a data access layer for an AI-powered application that provides a structured way to interact with a database. It implements the Repository and Unit of Work patterns to manage data operations for various entities related to AI models, conversations, user management, and more.

## Core Requirements

1. **Data Access Layer**: Provide a clean, abstracted interface for database operations.
2. **Entity Framework Core Integration**: Utilize EF Core for ORM capabilities.
3. **Repository Pattern**: Implement repositories for each entity to encapsulate data access logic.
4. **Unit of Work Pattern**: Coordinate operations across multiple repositories.
5. **Identity Integration**: Support user authentication and authorization through ASP.NET Identity.

## Project Goals

- **Maintainability**: Create a well-structured codebase that's easy to maintain and extend.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep data access logic separate from business logic.
- **Testability**: Design components that can be easily tested in isolation.
- **Scalability**: Support growing data needs and additional entity types.
- **Security**: Implement proper data access controls and user management.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Database context and configuration
- Entity definitions and relationships
- Repository implementations for all entities
- Unit of Work implementation
- Identity integration for user management

### Out of Scope
- Business logic implementation
- User interface components
- External API integrations
- Deployment infrastructure

This project serves as the foundation for data persistence in the Ollama application ecosystem, providing reliable and consistent data access patterns for higher-level application components.
