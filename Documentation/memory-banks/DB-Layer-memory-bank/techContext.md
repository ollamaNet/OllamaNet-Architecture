# Technical Context: Ollama DB Layer

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies

1. **C# / .NET**: The primary programming language and framework for the project.

2. **Entity Framework Core**: The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework used for database operations.

3. **ASP.NET Core**: The web framework that hosts the application and provides dependency injection.

4. **ASP.NET Identity**: Framework for managing users, roles, and authentication.

5. **SQL Server**: The relational database management system used for data storage.

### Development Tools

1. **Visual Studio**: The primary IDE for development.

2. **Entity Framework Core Tools**: For managing migrations and database updates.

3. **Git**: Version control system for source code management.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (compatible with the project version)
- SQL Server instance (local or remote)
- Visual Studio or another C# IDE

### Configuration

The application is configured through `appsettings.json` files, which include:

1. **Connection Strings**: Database connection information.

2. **Identity Settings**: Configuration for user management and authentication.

3. **Application-Specific Settings**: Any custom settings needed for the application.

Example connection string configuration:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=...;Database=...;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  }
}
```

### Database Migrations

The project uses Entity Framework Core migrations to manage database schema changes. Migrations are stored in the `Persistence/Migrations` directory and can be applied using EF Core tools.

Commands for working with migrations:

```bash
# Add a new migration
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName

# Apply migrations to the database
dotnet ef database update
```

## Technical Constraints

### Database Constraints

1. **SQL Server Dependency**: The application is designed to work with SQL Server and may require adjustments for other database systems.

2. **Entity Framework Limitations**: The project inherits any limitations of Entity Framework Core, such as complex query performance considerations.

3. **Identity Framework Integration**: The application extends ASP.NET Identity, which imposes certain schema requirements and patterns.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Query Optimization**: Repositories should implement efficient queries to avoid performance issues with large datasets.

2. **N+1 Query Problem**: Care must be taken to avoid the N+1 query problem when loading related entities.

3. **Transaction Scope**: The Unit of Work pattern helps manage transaction scope, but large transactions should be avoided.

### Security Constraints

1. **Data Protection**: Sensitive user data must be properly protected according to relevant regulations.

2. **Authorization**: Access to data should be properly controlled based on user roles and permissions.

3. **Input Validation**: All input data should be validated to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Dependencies

### Framework Dependencies

- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

### Project Dependencies

The DB Layer is designed to be a foundational component that other parts of the application depend on. It should have minimal dependencies on other application components to maintain a clean architecture.

### External Dependencies

The project does not have direct dependencies on external services, as it primarily focuses on database interactions. However, it may indirectly support integration with external systems through its data models and repositories.
