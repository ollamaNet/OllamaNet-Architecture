### Conflicting Requirements and Resolution Approach

Several areas of potential conflict have been identified between different stakeholders' requirements:

1. **Performance vs. Security**
   - **Conflict**: End users prioritize fast response times, while security stakeholders require thorough validation and protection measures that may introduce latency.
   - **Resolution**: Implement performance-optimized security measures, such as caching JWT validation results, using distributed authentication, and implementing parallel processing where possible.

2. **Usability vs. Compliance**
   - **Conflict**: Seamless user experience may conflict with compliance requirements for explicit consents and disclosures.
   - **Resolution**: Design user-friendly compliance features that integrate organically into the workflow, such as progressive disclosure of terms and just-in-time consent mechanisms.

3. **Flexibility vs. Governance**
   - **Conflict**: Technical stakeholders want maximum flexibility and customization, while governance stakeholders require standardization and controlled processes.
   - **Resolution**: Implement a modular architecture with clear extension points, coupled with governance policies on which aspects can be customized and how changes are managed.

4. **Notebook-First Architecture vs. Reliability**
   - **Conflict**: The InferenceService's notebook-first architecture provides flexibility but creates challenges for reliability and management.
   - **Resolution**: Implement robust service discovery mechanisms, monitoring, and auto-recovery while preserving the flexibility of the notebook environment.

5. **Centralized vs. Distributed Data**
   - **Conflict**: Performance and user experience benefit from distributed caching, while governance and management prefer centralized control.
   - **Resolution**: Implement a hybrid approach with a primary centralized database of record and distributed caching with clear invalidation strategies.

#### Context Mapping Strategies

The OllamaNet platform uses several context mapping patterns to manage relationships between bounded contexts:

1. **Shared Kernel**: The User domain is shared between contexts with consistent identity concepts
2. **Customer-Supplier**: Admin context provides model configurations that Inference context consumes
3. **Conformist**: Exploration context conforms to the model structures defined by Admin context
4. **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Conversation context uses adapters to protect from changes in the Inference context
5. **Open Host Service**: Authentication context provides standardized APIs for all other contexts to consume
