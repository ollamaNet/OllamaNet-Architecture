### Component Structure

#### Component Architecture Overview

The OllamaNet frontend implements a component architecture that emphasizes reusability, maintainability, and performance:

- **Atomic Design Methodology**: Components organized by complexity (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Components grouped by related functionality
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear parent-child relationships with controlled data flow
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component focuses on a specific task or view
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Component functionality extended through composition patterns
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand to improve initial load performance

This architecture provides a scalable foundation for the application's interface.

#### Component Hierarchy

The component hierarchy follows a logical organization:

1. **App Root**: The application entry point and global providers
2. **Layout Components**: Page structure elements (Header, Sidebar, Main, Footer)
3. **Page Components**: Top-level views for each major section
4. **Feature Components**: Functional units for specific capabilities
5. **Shared Components**: Reusable elements used across features
6. **Base Components**: Primitive UI elements with styling and behavior

This hierarchy maintains clear responsibilities at each level while enabling component reuse.

#### Reusable Component Library

The OllamaNet frontend includes a comprehensive component library:

- **Form Controls**: Inputs, selectors, checkboxes, radio buttons, toggles
- **Data Display**: Tables, cards, lists, badges, chips
- **Navigation**: Menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, pagination
- **Feedback**: Alerts, snackbars, progress indicators, tooltips
- **Layout**: Containers, grids, dividers, whitespace
- **Media**: Image displays, avatars, icons, media players
- **Specialized**: AI chat interface, model cards, conversation history

Each component is fully documented with props, usage examples, and accessibility considerations.

#### Component Composition Patterns

The frontend employs several composition patterns:

- **Compound Components**: Related components that work together (e.g., Form and FormItem)
- **Render Props**: Components that take functions as props to customize rendering
- **Higher-Order Components**: Functions that enhance components with additional capabilities
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extracted for use across components
- **Context Providers**: Components that provide shared state to descendant components
- **Slot Patterns**: Components with designated areas for custom content

These patterns enable flexible, reusable components while maintaining separation of concerns.

#### Container vs. Presentational Components

The application distinguishes between two component types:

- **Container Components**:
  - Manage state and data fetching
  - Connect to Redux store or API
  - Handle business logic
  - Minimal styling or visual elements
  - Focus on how things work

- **Presentational Components**:
  - Receive data via props
  - Focus on visual display
  - Contain styling and UI logic
  - Minimal state (only UI state)
  - Focus on how things look

This separation improves testability, reusability, and maintainability.

#### Component Lifecycle Management

The frontend implements systematic component lifecycle management:

- **Initialization**: Proper setup of state, refs, and effect dependencies
- **Data Loading**: Consistent patterns for fetching and displaying data
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of component errors
- **Cleanup**: Proper resource release when components unmount
- **Memoization**: Strategic optimization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **State Reset**: Clear patterns for resetting component state when needed

These practices ensure components perform efficiently and manage resources properly.

### State Management

#### State Management Architecture

The OllamaNet frontend implements a hybrid state management approach:

- **Redux**: For global application state (auth, user preferences, system-wide data)
- **Context API**: For intermediate state shared across component subtrees
- **Component State**: For local UI state using React's useState and useReducer

This tiered approach allows for appropriate state management based on the scope and complexity of the data.

#### Global vs. Local State

State is categorized based on its scope:

- **Global State** (Redux):
  - User authentication status
  - User profile and preferences
  - Active conversation data
  - Selected AI model information
  - System notifications

- **Intermediate State** (Context API):
  - Current view configuration
  - Feature-specific shared state
  - Theme and UI preferences
  - Multi-step form data

- **Local State** (Component):
  - Form input values
  - UI toggle states
  - Animation states
  - Temporary user interactions

This separation ensures each type of state is managed at the appropriate level.

#### State Update Patterns

The frontend implements consistent patterns for state updates:

- **Action Creators**: Factory functions that create standardized action objects
- **Reducers**: Pure functions that determine state changes based on actions
- **Selectors**: Functions that extract and derive data from state
- **Middleware**: Intercepts actions for side effects (API calls, logging)
- **Immutability**: State is never directly mutated, using immer or spread syntax
- **Normalization**: Complex data structures normalized for efficient updates

These patterns ensure predictable state changes and optimize performance.

#### Performance Optimization

Several strategies optimize state management performance:

- **Selective Rendering**: Components subscribe only to relevant state slices
- **Memoization**: React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary calculations
- **Batched Updates**: Multiple state updates combined when possible
- **Lazy Initialization**: Heavy initial state calculated only when needed
- **Virtualization**: Rendering only visible items in large lists
- **Debouncing/Throttling**: Controlling frequency of state updates from rapid user inputs

These optimizations maintain responsive performance even with complex state.

#### Data Flow Architecture

The application implements a unidirectional data flow:

1. **User Action**: Event triggered by user interaction
2. **Action Dispatch**: Action created and dispatched to store
3. **Reducer Processing**: Reducers compute new state based on action
4. **State Update**: Store updates with new state
5. **Re-render**: Connected components receive new state and re-render
6. **Side Effects**: Middleware handles side effects after state update

This predictable flow makes the application behavior easier to understand, debug, and test.

#### Caching Strategies

The frontend implements several caching strategies:

- **API Response Caching**: Temporary storage of API responses to reduce requests
- **Memoized Selectors**: Reselect library for efficient derived state
- **Persistent Storage**: Selected state persisted in localStorage/sessionStorage
- **Cache Invalidation**: Clear policies for when cached data should be refreshed
- **Prefetching**: Anticipatory data loading for likely user paths
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Using cached data while refreshing in background

These strategies balance data freshness with performance optimization.
