## Integration of InferenceService

The InferenceService (Spicy Avocado) should be integrated into the system architecture by:

1. Documenting its unique notebook-first architecture
2. Explaining its integration with other services through RabbitMQ
3. Describing its service discovery implementation
4. Addressing its distinctive deployment model via ngrok tunneling
5. Explaining how it fits into the overall system while maintaining its unique architecture

## Glossary Terms to Define

Key terms that should be defined for this chapter include:

- **API Gateway**: Component that acts as an entry point for client requests to microservices
- **Circuit Breaker**: Pattern that prevents cascading failures across services
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, a security feature implemented at the gateway
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token used for authentication between services
- **Microservice**: Independent deployable service with a specific domain responsibility
- **Ocelot**: API Gateway library used in the Gateway service
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker used for asynchronous communication and service discovery
- **Resilience Pattern**: Design patterns for handling failures in distributed systems
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer, architectural style for APIs
- **Service Discovery**: Mechanism for services to find and communicate with each other
- **ngrok**: Tool used by InferenceService to expose local services to the internet

## Professional Documentation Practices for Architecture Documentation

1. **Consistent Visual Language**: Use consistent notation in all architecture diagrams
2. **C4 Model Approach**: Follow the C4 model for architectural diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Code)
3. **Clear Traceability**: Show clear relationships between architectural decisions and requirements
4. **Multiple Viewpoints**: Present architecture from different perspectives (functional, deployment, security)
5. **Architecture Decision Records**: Document key decisions and their rationales
6. **Layered Information**: Present information in layers from high-level overview to detailed implementation
7. **Technology Mapping**: Clearly map technologies to architectural components
8. **View-Based Documentation**: Organize architecture documentation based on stakeholder concerns

## Diagram Standards and Notation

1. **C4 Model Notation**: For system context and container diagrams
2. **UML Sequence Diagrams**: For communication and request flows
3. **UML Component Diagrams**: For showing component relationships
4. **Technology-Specific Icons**: Use recognizable icons for technologies (Redis, SQL Server, RabbitMQ)
5. **Consistent Color Coding**: Use consistent colors for different types of components
6. **Clear Boundaries**: Clearly show system and service boundaries
7. **Layered Diagrams**: Use layered approaches for complex architectures

## Potential Challenges

- Reconciling potentially different architectural descriptions across services
- Ensuring consistent terminology across service documentation
- Creating coherent architecture diagrams from varied source materials
- Explaining the unique deployment model of the InferenceService within the overall architecture
- Documenting evolving architectural patterns and planned improvements
- Balancing technical detail with clarity for different audiences

## Next Steps After Approval

1. Review all identified files
2. Inventory existing architecture diagrams
3. Create a consistent architectural view of the entire system
4. Draft key sections starting with the overall architecture
5. Create missing diagrams using consistent notation
6. Validate architectural descriptions with existing implementations
7. Integrate the InferenceService into the architectural narrative
8. Add glossary entries for key terms
9. Review for consistency with previous chapters
