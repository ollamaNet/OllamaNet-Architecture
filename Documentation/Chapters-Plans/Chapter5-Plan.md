## Integration of InferenceService

The InferenceService database integration should be addressed by:

2. Explaining any special data persistence needs for inference results
3. Describing how service discovery information is persisted
4. Addressing any unique data consistency challenges posed by the notebook-based deployment

## Glossary Terms to Define

Key terms that should be defined for this chapter include:

- **Repository Pattern**: Design pattern that mediates between the domain model and data source
- **Unit of Work**: Pattern that maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction
- **Entity Framework Core**: Object-relational mapper used for database access
- **SQL Server**: The relational database management system used by OllamaNet
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching

- **Entity**: A class that maps to a database table
- **Migration**: The process of evolving the database schema over time
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Strategy for handling concurrent data modifications
- **Distributed Cache**: Cache shared across multiple services or instances
- **Database Context**: EF Core's primary class that coordinates entity framework functionality
- **Connection Pooling**: Technique for managing database connections efficiently

## Professional Documentation Practices for Database Documentation

1. **Complete Entity Coverage**: Document all entities and their relationships
2. **Performance Considerations**: Document query optimization techniques and considerations
3. **Transaction Boundaries**: Clearly define transaction boundaries and isolation levels

7. **Indexing Strategy**: Document the indexing strategy for performance optimization
8. **Query Examples**: Provide examples of common query patterns
9. **Error Handling**: Document error handling strategies for database operations

## Diagram Standards and Notation

1. **Entity Relationship Diagrams**: Use standard ERD notation (Chen or Crow's Foot)
2. **UML Class Diagrams**: For object-oriented representation of entities
3. **Sequence Diagrams**: For database operation flows
4. **BPMN**: For transaction and migration processes
5. **Consistency in Cardinality Notation**: Use consistent notation for relationships
6. **Color Coding**: Use consistent colors for different types of entities
7. **Layered Diagrams**: Show logical separation in shared database approach

## Potential Challenges

- Documenting complex entity relationships in a clear, understandable way

4. Create diagrams for data consistency strategies and caching
5. Document migration and versioning approaches
6. Validate database documentation against actual implementation
7. Add glossary entries for key database terms
8. Ensure consistency with system architecture chapter
9. Review for completeness and accuracy
