# Chapter 3: Requirements Analysis - Documentation Plan

## Purpose
This plan outlines the approach for developing the Requirements Analysis chapter, detailing stakeholder needs, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and domain modeling for the OllamaNet platform.

## Files to Review

   - Legal and compliance requirements

4. **User Stories and Personas**
   - Key user personas
   - User journeys
   - User stories by service domain
   - Acceptance criteria

5. **Domain Model**
   - Core domain entities
   - Relationships between entities
   - Domain constraints
   - Bounded contexts and their relationships

### Domain Model Diagrams
8. **Entity Relationship Diagram**
   - Comprehensive diagram showing all entities and their relationships
   - Source: DB layer documentation and entity relationship files

9. **Domain Model Class Diagram**
   - UML class diagram showing domain classes and relationships
   - Source: Create based on system design documents and DB layer

10. **Bounded Context Map**
    - Diagram showing service boundaries and context mapping
    - Source: Create based on system patterns documentation

11. **Aggregate Root Diagram**
    - Visualization of key aggregates and their components
    - Source: Create based on domain model analysis

## Key Information to Extract

### From Project Briefs and Product Context
- Business goals and objectives
- Core problems being solved
- Target user groups
- Key requirements (stated explicitly or implied)
- Success criteria and metrics

### From System Design Documents
- Technical requirements
- Architecture constraints
- Integration requirements
- Scalability and performance requirements

### From Entity Relationships and DB Layer
- Domain entities and relationships
- Data constraints and validation rules
- Storage and retrieval requirements

### From Active Context and Progress
- Evolving requirements
- Implementation priorities
- Challenges encountered during implementation

## Integration of InferenceService

The InferenceService (Spicy Avocado) should be integrated into the requirements analysis by:

1. Identifying its specific functional requirements
2. Documenting its unique non-functional requirements (especially related to cloud notebook deployment)
3. Adding relevant user stories and personas
4. Including its domain entities in the overall domain model
5. Addressing its integration requirements with other services

## Glossary Terms to Define

Key terms that should be defined for this chapter include:

- **Functional Requirement**: A requirement that specifies what the system should do
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: A requirement that specifies how the system performs a function
- **User Story**: A simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person desiring the capability
- **Persona**: A fictional character created to represent a user type that might use the system
- **Domain Model**: A conceptual model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data
- **Entity**: A discrete, identifiable object in the domain model
- **Bounded Context**: A conceptual boundary within which a domain model is defined and applicable
- **Aggregate**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit
- **Service Capability**: A discrete function or set of functions provided by a service
- **Stakeholder**: Any person, group, or organization with an interest in or concern about the project

## Approach to Requirements Gathering and Analysis

1. **Extraction**: Identify explicit and implicit requirements from all documentation sources
2. **Categorization**: Organize requirements by type and service domain
3. **Consolidation**: Eliminate duplicates and resolve conflicts
4. **Prioritization**: Identify high, medium, and low priority requirements
5. **Validation**: Cross-check requirements against stated business goals and user needs
6. **Modeling**: Create domain models and user journeys to validate completeness

## Professional Documentation Practices for Requirements

1. **Clear Language**: Use simple, direct language avoiding ambiguity
2. **Consistent Structure**: Use consistent format for all requirements (e.g., "The system shall...")
3. **Traceability**: Link requirements to their sources and dependent components
4. **Measurability**: Ensure non-functional requirements have clear metrics
5. **Testability**: Structure requirements so they can be validated
6. **Priority Indication**: Clearly indicate requirement priority
7. **Version Control**: Note requirement changes and evolution

## Requirements Diagram Standards

1. **Use Case Diagrams**: UML standard notation
2. **Entity Relationship Diagrams**: Chen or Crow's Foot notation (consistent throughout)
3. **Domain Model**: UML Class Diagram notation
4. **User Journeys**: Sequential flow diagrams with decision points
5. **Bounded Context Maps**: Context Mapping patterns from DDD

## Potential Challenges

- Reconciling potentially conflicting requirements across services
- Extracting implicit requirements not explicitly stated in documentation
- Ensuring consistent level of detail for requirements across services
- Maintaining traceability between requirements, user stories, and domain model
- Integrating the unique deployment model of InferenceService with overall requirements

## Next Steps After Approval

1. Review all identified files
2. Extract and categorize requirements from all sources
3. Create preliminary versions of key diagrams
4. Draft domain model based on entity relationships
5. Develop user personas and stories
6. Complete full requirements documentation with integrated diagrams
7. Add glossary entries for key terms
8. Review for consistency with previous chapters
