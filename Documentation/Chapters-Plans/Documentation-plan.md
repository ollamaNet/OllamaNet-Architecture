# OllamaNet Microservices Documentation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the process for extracting information from individual service memory banks and consolidating it into comprehensive system documentation that follows the structure in `MicroservicesDocumentationStructure.md`.

## Documentation Phases and Required Files

### Phase 1: Project Foundation & Context
**Target document sections:**
- Front Matter
- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: Background (partial)

**Files to read:**
- All services: `projectbrief.md`
- All services: `productContext.md`
- Memory bank: `glossary.pdf`

**Outcome:** Establish project context, problem statement, objectives, and theoretical background.

### Phase 2: Requirements Analysis & System Architecture
**Target document sections:**
- Chapter 3: Requirements Analysis
- Chapter 4: System Architecture

**Files to read:**
- All services: `SystemDesign.md`
- All services: `systemPatterns.md`
- Memory bank: `systemPatterns.md`

**Outcome:** Document overall architecture, service decomposition, communication patterns, and cross-cutting concerns.

### Phase 3: Database Architecture & Data Models
**Target document sections:**
- Chapter 5: Database Layer

**Files to read:**
- DB-Layer: `entityRelationships.md`
- DB-Layer: `codeExamples.md`
- DB-Layer: `techContext.md`
- DB-Layer: `systemPatterns.md`

**Outcome:** Document database architecture, data models, consistency strategies, and technologies.

### Phase 4: Individual Service Design & Implementation
**Target document sections:**
- Chapter 6: Detailed Service Designs
- Chapter 9: Implementation Details (partial)

**Files to read for each service:**
- `SystemDesign.md`
- `techContext.md`
- `systemPatterns.md`
- `activeContext.md`

**Services to cover:**
1. AdminService
2. AuthService
3. ExploreService
4. ConversationService

**Outcome:** Detailed documentation of each service's purpose, API design, components, and implementation details.

### Phase 5: Testing & Evaluation
**Target document sections:**
- Chapter 8: Testing Strategy
- Chapter 10: System Evaluation

**Files to read:**
- All services: `progress.md`
- All services: `techContext.md` (for testing approaches)
- Memory bank: `progress.md`

**Outcome:** Document testing strategies, performance metrics, and system evaluation.

### Phase 6: Frontend, Deployment & Future Work
**Target document sections:**
- Chapter 7: Frontend Architecture
- Chapter 9: Implementation Details (completion)
- Chapter 11: Conclusion & Future Work

**Files to read:**
- All services: `progress.md` (for future work)
- All services: `activeContext.md` (for current development status)
- Memory bank: `progress.md`

**Outcome:** Document frontend integration, deployment considerations, and future enhancements.

### Phase 7: Finalization
**Target document sections:**
- References
- Appendices
- Final review and formatting

**Files to read:**
- Any supplementary diagrams from `/memory-bank/diagrams/`
- Any additional technical references from service memory banks

**Outcome:** Complete documentation with references, appendices, and consistent formatting.

## Documentation Process

For each phase:

1. Extract relevant information from specified files
2. Organize information according to the structure
3. Identify gaps requiring additional investigation
4. Update the corresponding sections in the memory bank
5. Cross-reference information between services to ensure consistency
6. Validate documentation against the requirements in MicroservicesDocumentationStructure.md

## Special Considerations

- **Consistency:** Ensure consistent terminology across services
- **Diagrams:** Collect and integrate all relevant diagrams
- **Cross-cutting concerns:** Document patterns that span multiple services
- **Technical debt:** Document known limitations and planned improvements
- **Service interactions:** Focus on how services interact with each other
