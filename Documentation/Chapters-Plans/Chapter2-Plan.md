## Key Information to Extract

### From System Patterns
- Architectural design decisions

- Design patterns implemented
- Domain model organization
- Cross-cutting concerns

### From Technical Context

- Framework selection rationale
- Library and tool justifications
- Technical constraints and solutions
- Performance considerations

### From System Design Documents
- High-level architectural decisions
- Service boundaries and responsibilities
- Integration strategies
- Infrastructure requirements

## Integration of InferenceService

The InferenceService (Spicy Avocado) should be incorporated into the background chapter by:

1. Including its architectural approach in the microservices overview
2. Documenting its technological choices and constraints
3. Explaining how it fits into the overall system architecture
4. Addressing its unique deployment model (cloud notebooks with ngrok)

## Glossary Terms to Define

Key terms that should be defined for this chapter include:

- **Microservice**: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are independently deployable
- **Domain-Driven Design**: An approach to software development that focuses on understanding the business domain
- **Bounded Context**: A conceptual boundary within which a particular domain model applies
- **Repository Pattern**: A design pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers
- **Unit of Work**: A pattern that maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token, a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems
- **Caching**: Storing copies of data in a high-speed data store to reduce database load
- **ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping, a technique for converting data between incompatible type systems
- **API Gateway**: A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests and routing them to appropriate services

## Approach to Diagram Creation and Selection

1. **Inventory Existing Diagrams**: Catalog all diagrams in service documentation
2. **Identify Gaps**: Determine which required diagrams are missing
3. **Standardize Format**: Ensure consistent style and notation across diagrams
4. **Create Missing Diagrams**: Develop new diagrams based on documentation content
5. **Optimize for Clarity**: Ensure diagrams effectively communicate intended concepts

## Professional Documentation Practices for Diagrams

1. **Consistent Notation**: Use standard UML or C4 notation where appropriate
2. **Clear Labeling**: All components and connections should be clearly labeled
3. **Legend Inclusion**: Include legends for complex diagrams
4. **High Resolution**: Ensure diagrams are high resolution and readable when printed
5. **Text Alternative**: Provide text descriptions for accessibility
6. **Color Considerations**: Use color to enhance understanding, not as the sole differentiator
7. **Hierarchical Organization**: Show both high-level and detailed views where appropriate

## Potential Challenges

- Finding or creating appropriate diagrams to illustrate complex concepts
- Ensuring consistency in diagram formats and notation across different services
- Reconciling potentially different architectural approaches between services
- Balancing technical depth with accessibility for different audience levels
- Integrating the unique deployment model of the InferenceService with the overall architecture

## Next Steps After Approval

1. Review all identified files
2. Inventory existing diagrams from all services
3. Extract and organize the information according to the section structure
4. Identify gaps in diagram coverage and create new diagrams as needed
5. Draft Chapter 2 with integrated diagrams and figures
6. Add glossary entries for key terms
7. Review for consistency with Chapter 1
