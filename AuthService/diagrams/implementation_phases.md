# AuthService Diagrams Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for creating a comprehensive set of architecture diagrams for the AuthService. Each phase should be implemented sequentially, with review and validation between phases.

## Phase 1: System Context and Container Diagrams

**Success Criteria**:
- All external systems and dependencies identified
- Clear system boundaries established
- Major containers and their relationships documented
- Basic flow directions indicated

## Phase 2: Component Architecture and Class Diagrams

**Objective**: Document the internal architecture and key classes

**Activities**:
1. Review AuthController, IAuthService implementation, and JWTManager
2. Identify key interfaces and their implementations
3. Create Component Architecture diagram showing internal structure
4. Create Class Diagram for key entities (ApplicationUser, RefreshToken)
5. Create Class Diagram for service interfaces and DTOs

**Deliverables**:
- `component_diagrams/auth_service_components.puml`

**Success Criteria**:
- All major components identified and relationships mapped
- Key interfaces and their implementations documented
- Domain model classes with properties documented
- Service interfaces with methods documented

## Phase 3: Authentication Flow Sequence Diagrams

**Objective**: Document the core authentication processes

**Activities**:
1. Review authentication flows in AuthController and AuthService
2. Create Sequence Diagram for user registration
3. Create Sequence Diagram for login process
4. Create Sequence Diagram for token refresh
5. Create Sequence Diagram for logout process

**Deliverables**:
- `sequence_diagrams/user_registration.puml`
- `sequence_diagrams/user_login.puml`
- `sequence_diagrams/token_refresh.puml`
- `sequence_diagrams/user_logout.puml`

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete flow documented for each process
- Token generation and validation steps included
- Error paths identified
- Cookie handling documented

## Phase 4: User Management Sequence Diagrams

**Objective**: Document the user management processes

**Activities**:
1. Review user management flows in AuthController and AuthService
2. Create Sequence Diagram for password change
3. Create Sequence Diagram for password reset
4. Create Sequence Diagram for profile update
5. Create Sequence Diagram for role assignment/removal

**Deliverables**:
- `sequence_diagrams/password_change.puml`
- `sequence_diagrams/password_reset.puml`
- `sequence_diagrams/profile_update.puml`
- `sequence_diagrams/role_management.puml`

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete flow documented for each process
- Security validations included
- Error paths identified
- Role-based authorization checks documented

## Phase 5: Data Flow Diagrams

**Objective**: Document how data moves through the system

**Activities**:
1. Analyze the data transformations in authentication processes
2. Create Data Flow Diagram for user registration data
3. Create Data Flow Diagram for authentication flow
4. Create Data Flow Diagram for token management
5. Create Data Flow Diagram for user management

**Deliverables**:
- `data_flow_diagrams/user_registration_flow.puml`
- `data_flow_diagrams/authentication_flow.puml`
- `data_flow_diagrams/token_management_flow.puml`
- `data_flow_diagrams/user_management_flow.puml`

**Success Criteria**:
- Data transformation steps identified
- Storage points documented
- Validation steps included
- Security boundaries clearly marked

## Phase 6: State Machine Diagrams

**Objective**: Document the states and transitions for key entities

**Activities**:
1. Identify states for user accounts
2. Identify states for authentication tokens
3. Identify states for password reset process
4. Create State Machine Diagrams for each entity

**Deliverables**:
- `state_machine_diagrams/user_account_states.puml`
- `state_machine_diagrams/token_states.puml`
- `state_machine_diagrams/password_reset_states.puml`

**Success Criteria**:
- All possible states identified
- Transition conditions documented
- Error states and recovery paths included
- Timers and expiration transitions documented

## Phase 7: Infrastructure and Integration Diagrams

**Objective**: Document the deployment and integration aspects

**Activities**:
1. Review infrastructure setup in Program.cs and appsettings.json
2. Document database schema for users and tokens
3. Document Redis integration (if used)
4. Document integration points with other services

**Deliverables**:
- `infrastructure_diagrams/auth_service_infrastructure.puml`
- `infrastructure_diagrams/data_persistence.puml`
- `integration_diagrams/service_integration.puml`

**Success Criteria**:
- Database architecture documented
- Caching strategy documented
- Service registration patterns documented
- Integration points with other services mapped
- Security infrastructure documented

## Phase 8: Compilation and Documentation

**Objective**: Generate final diagrams and documentation

**Activities**:
1. Compile all diagrams using compile_diagrams.bat
2. Review compiled diagrams for consistency
3. Update README.md with overview of diagrams
4. Update memory bank documentation

**Deliverables**:
- Compiled PNG files in the compiled/ directory
- Updated README.md
- Updated memory bank documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- All diagrams compiled successfully
- Diagrams are consistent in style and naming
- Documentation is updated
- Memory bank reflects the current state

## Execution Approach

Each phase should be executed sequentially with the following steps:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Review relevant code files
   - Answer clarifying questions from the implementation plan
   - Document assumptions

2. **Development**:
   - Create draft diagrams based on the implementation plan
   - Follow naming conventions and style guidelines
   - Include notes and explanations where needed

3. **Review**:
   - Validate diagrams against actual code
   - Check for missing components or relationships
   - Verify accuracy of flows and processes

4. **Finalization**:
   - Update diagrams based on review feedback
   - Compile to PNG format
   - Update documentation

5. **Move to Next Phase**:
   - Confirm current phase completion
   - Begin preparation for next phase
