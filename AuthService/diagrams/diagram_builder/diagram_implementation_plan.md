## General Implementation Tips

1. **Start with Questions**
   - Answer all clarifying questions first
   - Document assumptions
   - Validate understanding with team

2. **File Review Process**
   - Start with Program.cs and ServiceExtensions.cs
   - Review the authentication controller
   - Examine the auth service implementation
   - Look at token handling components
   - Check data persistence mechanisms

3. **Detail Gathering**
   - Use a checklist for required details
   - Mark missing information
   - Note areas needing clarification
   - Document design decisions

4. **Validation Steps**
   - Review with technical team
   - Validate against code
   - Check for missing components
   - Verify relationships

5. **Documentation**
   - Note key decisions
   - Document assumptions
   - List open questions
   - Include relevant code references

## Using This Plan

1. For each diagram type:
   - Review the files listed
