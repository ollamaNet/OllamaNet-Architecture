# Active Context for AuthService

## Current Focus
- Maintaining a clean, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Ensuring all cross-cutting concerns are under Infrastructure (DataSeeding, Caching, Logging, Email)
- Enforcing dependency injection and the options pattern throughout the codebase
- Keeping documentation and memory bank up to date with all architectural changes
- Using organized service registrations with extension methods for better code organization

## Recent Changes
- DataSeeding moved under Infrastructure for consistency
- Placeholder folders for Caching, Logging, and Email created under Infrastructure
- System design plan documented and divided into implementation phases
- Pattern enforcement audit completed (DI, options, SRP)
- No misplaced files or architectural violations found
- Service registrations organized with extension methods for improved readability

## Current Status
- Folder structure matches the system design plan
- All services, helpers, and infrastructure components use dependency injection
- All configuration uses the options pattern (IOptions<T>)
- Single Responsibility Principle enforced across all classes
- Codebase is ready for future extensibility (caching, logging, email, etc.)
- Documentation and memory bank are being actively maintained
- Service defaults integrated for common functionality across microservices

## Active Decisions
- All cross-cutting concerns to be placed under Infrastructure
- Use DI and options pattern for all new features
- Maintain strict SRP and clear folder/class responsibilities
- Document all major architectural changes in Docs/ and memory bank
- Continue using extension methods for organizing service registrations

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of future cross-cutting concerns as needed (caching, logging, email)
- Continue to update documentation and diagrams as the architecture evolves
- Maintain regular audits for architectural consistency
- **Update or add diagrams in Docs/Diagrams/ to reflect the new architecture and flows**
- Review and potentially enhance the CORS policy configuration

## Implementation Details
- Infrastructure folder now contains DataSeeding and placeholders for Caching, Logging, and Email
- All service and helper dependencies are injected via DI
- All configuration is strongly-typed and bound via options pattern
- Program.cs uses organized extension methods for service registration
- Service defaults integrated for common functionality across microservices

## Open Questions
- What is the monitoring strategy for failed authentication attempts?
- How should expired/revoked refresh tokens be cleaned up from the database?
- Is there a need for additional roles beyond User and Admin?
- Should we implement more granular permissions within roles?
- What is the strategy for handling mass token revocation in security breach scenarios?
- How should password policy be enhanced beyond ASP.NET Identity defaults?
- Should we implement API rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks?

## Current Context
The AuthService is now highly maintainable, readable, and consistent, with a folder structure and architectural patterns that support future growth and cross-cutting concerns. The system design plan is documented and being followed phase by phase, ensuring best practices and maintainability. Service registration is well-organized using extension methods, promoting clean code and better separation of concerns.
