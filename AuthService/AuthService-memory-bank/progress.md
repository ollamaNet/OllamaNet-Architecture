# Progress Tracking for AuthService

## Completed Components
- Core API controller (AuthController) with comprehensive endpoints:
  - User registration with validation
  - Authentication (login) with token issuance
  - Profile management with token-based user identification
  - Password management flows:
    - Change password with old password verification
    - Forgot password with token generation
    - Reset password with token validation
  - Role management (assign/deassign) with admin restrictions
  - Token refresh with old token revocation
  - Logout with token invalidation
  - Role retrieval
- IAuthService interface and implementation with robust functionality
- JWTManager for token operations:
  - JWT token generation with appropriate claims
  - Token validation with comprehensive parameters
  - Refresh token generation with cryptographic randomness
- Secure cookie management for refresh tokens
- ASP.NET Identity integration for user and role management
- JWT authentication configuration with proper validation parameters
- Role-based authorization policies
- Database integration for user and token storage
- Root folder creation for new users during registration
- Memory bank documentation

## Working Functionality
- User registration with automatic role assignment and root folder creation
- Authentication with JWT token issuance and HTTP-only cookie for refresh token
- Refresh token mechanism with one-time use pattern and token rotation
- Password management workflows with validation and security checks
- Profile updates with token-based user identification
- Role assignment and removal with admin-only access
- Token validation with expiration and revocation checks
- Secure logout with token invalidation
- Role retrieval by user ID

## Implementation Accomplishments
- One-time use pattern for refresh tokens (revocation after use)
- HTTP-only, secure cookies for refresh token transmission
- Token-based user identification for profile operations
- Root folder creation during user registration process
- Password reuse prevention in reset and change workflows
- Email format validation in password recovery flow
- Comprehensive input validation at controller level
- Token claims including user ID for secure operations

## In Progress
- Memory bank documentation completion and enhancement
- Security review and potential enhancements

## Pending Work
- Automated cleanup of expired/revoked refresh tokens
- Comprehensive security-focused logging implementation
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Secure storage for sensitive configuration
- Token revocation strategy for security breaches
- Login failure monitoring and suspicious activity detection
- Two-Factor Authentication implementation

## Known Issues
- No automated cleanup of expired/revoked refresh tokens
- Limited logging for security events
- Connection strings stored in appsettings.json (should be moved to secure storage)
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Password reset link hardcoded to localhost in ForgotPasswordAsync
- Limited error details for failed login attempts (security by design)

## Recent Milestones
- Memory bank documentation enhanced with implementation details
- Token handling and security patterns fully documented
- Input validation and cookie management details documented

## Next Milestones
- Implement automated refresh token cleanup mechanism
- Add comprehensive security logging
- Develop token revocation strategy for security breaches
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Move sensitive configuration to secure storage
- Enhance password policies beyond Identity defaults

## Performance Considerations
- JWT validation performance at scale
- Database queries for refresh token validation
- Password hashing operations during authentication
- Token storage and retrieval efficiency
- Consider caching frequently accessed user data

## Security Roadmap
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Add comprehensive security logging with alerting
- Develop mass token revocation strategy
- Implement automated expired/revoked token cleanup
- Move sensitive configuration to secure storage
- Enhance password policies
- Implement Two-Factor Authentication
- Add login anomaly detection
- Implement IP-based restrictions for suspicious activity
- Consider JSON Web Encryption (JWE) for sensitive claims
