# Data Seeding Implementation Plan (Phased)

## Overview
Implement a robust data seeding mechanism for roles and admin accounts using a dedicated service class approach, following the Single Responsibility Principle and project conventions.

---

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Create folders:
  - `AuthService/Infrastructure/DataSeeding/Interfaces/`
  - `AuthService/Infrastructure/DataSeeding/Options/`
  - `AuthService/Infrastructure/DataSeeding/Services/`
- Add `DataSeeding` configuration section to `appsettings.json` (roles, admin account, retry policy)
- Create `DataSeedingOptions` class in `Options/` following the Options pattern

## Phase 2: Interface Layer
- Define contracts in `Interfaces/`:
  - `IDataSeeder` (main orchestrator)
  - `IRoleSeeder` (role management)
  - `IUserSeeder` (admin user creation)

## Phase 3: Service Implementation
- Implement services in `Services/`:
  - `DataSeeder` (main orchestrator, retry logic, logging)
  - `RoleSeeder` (role management)
  - `UserSeeder` (admin user creation)
- Use dependency injection and logging as per project standards
- Add error handling and retry logic (Polly)

## Phase 4: Integration
- Add extension method in `ServiceExtensions.cs` for seeding services registration
- Update `Program.cs` to use the new seeding approach and remove old seeding code

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
- Add unit tests for each seeder component
- Add integration tests for the full seeding process
- Update documentation for usage and maintenance

---

## Naming & Architectural Conventions
- Follow the clean, layered architecture and naming conventions as described in the memory bank
- Use dependency injection and options pattern for configuration
- Place all new code under `Infrastructure/DataSeeding` to match existing structure
- Use logging and error handling patterns consistent with the rest of the project

---

## Next Step: Implement Phase 1
- Create folder structure
- Add DataSeeding section to appsettings.json
- Create DataSeedingOptions class
