# Active Context for AdminService

## Current Focus
- Implementing the new architecture design as defined in NewSystemDesign.md
- Executing the migration plan outlined in MigrationPlan.md
- Tracking migration progress using MigrationTracking.md
- Reorganizing code by domain and implementing proper separation of concerns

## Recent Changes
- Created comprehensive architecture design document (NewSystemDesign.md)
- Developed detailed migration plan with phases (MigrationPlan.md)
- Created migration tracking document to monitor progress (MigrationTracking.md)
- Analyzed existing code for dependencies and hard-coded values
- Designed new folder structure with domain-driven organization

## Current Status
- Migration is in the planning phase with documentation created
- Current architecture has four main operation domains that will be reorganized:
  - UserOperations: to be moved to User domain
  - AIModelOperations: to be moved to AIModel domain
  - TagOperations: to be moved to Tag domain
  - InferenceOperations: to be moved to Inference domain
- Controllers, services, and validators will be reorganized by domain
- New Infrastructure layer will be created for cross-cutting concerns
- Migration tracking document created to monitor file movements

## Active Decisions
- Domain-driven organization (User, AIModel, Tag, Inference)
- Infrastructure layer for cross-cutting concerns
- Options pattern for configuration management
- Global exception handling for consistent error responses
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Caching strategy with domain-specific TTLs
- No caching for inference operations
- Renaming OllamaConnector to InferenceEngineConnector
- Removal of AdminController

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 0: Preparation and Analysis**
   - Create new directory structure
   - Analyze existing code for dependencies
   - Document API contracts to ensure they remain unchanged

2. **Phase 1: Infrastructure Layer Setup**
   - Implement configuration management with options pattern
   - Create logging implementation with Serilog
   - Set up caching layer with Redis
   - Prepare authentication framework (commented)
   - Create integration layer for external services

3. **Phase 2: Domain Services Layer**
   - Implement domain-specific services with proper DTOs and mappers
   - Ensure no changes to DTOs that would require database migrations
   - Organize services by domain (User, AIModel, Tag, Inference)

4. **Phase 3: Controllers and Validators**
   - Reorganize controllers by domain
   - Move validators to domain-specific folders
   - Update controllers to use new service interfaces
   - Verify API contracts remain unchanged

## Open Questions
- How to handle the transition period during migration?
- Should we implement the migration in a feature branch or directly in the main branch?
- What is the priority order for implementing the phases?
- How to verify API contracts remain unchanged during migration?
- What testing strategy should be used to validate the migration?
- Are there any performance considerations for the new architecture?

## Migration Plan
The migration is organized into seven phases:
1. **Preparation and Analysis**: Set up foundation and analyze existing code
2. **Infrastructure Layer Setup**: Establish cross-cutting concerns
3. **Domain Services Layer**: Implement domain-specific services
4. **Controllers and Validators**: Reorganize by domain
5. **Error Handling and Validation**: Implement consistent approach
6. **Integration and Testing**: Integrate all components and test
7. **Documentation and Cleanup**: Finalize documentation and remove obsolete components

## Performance Considerations
- Database query optimization for user and model operations
- Caching strategy with appropriate TTLs per domain:
  - User profiles: 5 minutes TTL
  - User roles: 15 minutes TTL
  - Model metadata: 10 minutes TTL
  - Model tags: 15 minutes TTL
  - All tags: 30 minutes TTL
  - Tag relationships: 15 minutes TTL
  - No caching for inference operations
- Connection pooling for database access
- Streaming implementation for large data transfers
- Pagination for collection endpoints

## Current Context
The AdminService is undergoing a significant architectural restructuring to improve organization, maintainability, and scalability. The new architecture follows domain-driven design principles with clear separation of concerns. The migration plan outlines a phased approach to minimize disruption while ensuring API contracts remain unchanged. The infrastructure layer will provide cross-cutting concerns like caching, logging, and configuration management. Each domain (User, AIModel, Tag, Inference) will have its own controllers, services, DTOs, and validators.
