# Active Context for AdminService

## Current Focus
- Standardizing caching implementation between services to ensure consistent behavior
- Resolving Redis caching timeout issues during URL updates
- Fine-tuning service discovery with RabbitMQ and Redis

## Recent Changes
- Refactored caching implementation to match ConversationService's approach
- Added proper JSON serialization/deserialization for Redis cache values
- Created CacheManager for higher-level cache abstraction
- Added RedisCacheSettings with proper timeout configuration
- Enhanced error handling with dedicated cache exception types
- Memory bank documentation created and refined
- Full code review completed with detailed component analysis
- Documentation of architecture patterns and system organization

## Current Status
- AdminService is fully implemented with four main operation domains:
  - UserOperations: comprehensive user management with role-based controls
  - AIModelOperations: complete model administration with tag management
  - TagOperations: tag creation and management for content organization
  - InferenceOperations: Ollama integration for model management
- Controllers implemented with FluentValidation for request validation
- Services implemented with proper business logic encapsulation
- OllamaConnector provides structured integration with the Ollama API
- Streaming implementation for model installation progress
- JWT authentication structure defined but currently commented out
- Swagger documentation enabled with JWT support
- Database integration via Unit of Work pattern
- Redis caching implemented but experiencing timeout issues during URL updates

## Active Decisions
- Standardize caching approach across services to ensure consistent serialization
- Use JSON serialization for all cached values in Redis
- Increase timeout values for Redis operations to prevent timeouts with cloud Redis instances
- Controller organization by domain (User, Model, Tag, Inference)
- FluentValidation for comprehensive request validation
- Try/catch with contextual logging for robust error handling
- RESTful API design with appropriate HTTP methods
- Stream-based progress reporting for long-running operations
- JWT authentication structure defined but temporarily disabled
- SQL Server for data persistence with Entity Framework Core

## Next Steps
- Increase Redis operation timeout values to resolve URL update issues
- Consider implementing asynchronous cache updates to prevent blocking operations
- Optimize Redis connection handling for better resilience
- Enable JWT authentication by uncommenting the relevant code in Program.cs
- Implement audit logging for administrative actions
- Review and optimize caching strategy for administrative data
- Add rate limiting for sensitive administrative endpoints
- Enhance error handling for external service failures
- Implement comprehensive integration testing

## Open Questions
- Should Redis operation timeouts be increased or should we implement more robust async caching?
- Are there other serialization inconsistencies between services that need to be addressed?
- Should authentication be implemented at the gateway level or within the service?
- What level of granularity is needed for audit logging?
- Is the current Redis caching configuration sufficient for production use?
- How should rate limiting be implemented for administrative endpoints?
- What monitoring approach should be used for administrative operations?
- How should the AdminController.cs functionality be integrated with the specialized controllers?

## Current Context
The AdminService provides a comprehensive administrative API for the OllamaNet platform, structured into four main operation domains (User, Model, Tag, Inference) with corresponding controller and service implementations. Recent work has focused on standardizing the caching implementation between AdminService and ConversationService to ensure consistent behavior, particularly for the InferenceEngine URL which is shared between services. The service is currently experiencing Redis timeout issues during URL updates, which affects persistence between service restarts. Otherwise, the service has a solid foundation with well-structured components, but requires enablement of authentication and implementation of additional security measures before production deployment.
