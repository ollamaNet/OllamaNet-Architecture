# Progress Tracking for AdminService

## Completed Components
- Core API controllers with comprehensive endpoints:
  - UserOperationsController for complete user management
  - AIModelOperationsController for model administration
  - TagOperationsController for tag management
  - InferenceOperationsController for Ollama integration
- Service implementations with business logic:
  - UserOperationsService for user and role operations
  - AIModelOperationsService for model management
  - TagsOperationsService for tag administration
  - InferenceOperationsService for Ollama operations
- FluentValidation implementation with comprehensive validators:
  - CreateModelRequestValidator, UpdateModelRequestValidator
  - ModelTagOperationRequestValidator, SearchModelRequestValidator
  - UserAdminValidators (CreateUserRequestValidator, UpdateUserProfileRequestValidator, etc.)
- OllamaConnector for Ollama API integration
- Repository registrations and database integration via Unit of Work pattern
- Configuration for various components:
  - Database connection (SQL Server)
  - Redis caching (configured with Upstash)
  - CORS for frontend integration
  - JWT authentication (structure defined but commented out)
- Swagger documentation with JWT support
- Error handling with try/catch and appropriate status codes
- Streaming implementation for model installation progress
- Memory bank documentation

## Working Functionality
- User management (CRUD operations, search, role management, lock/unlock)
- AI model administration (create, update, delete, tag assignment)
- Tag management (create, update, delete)
- Inference operations (model info, listing, installation, removal)
- Request validation with FluentValidation
- Error handling with appropriate status codes and contextual logging
- Streaming progress for model installation via Server-Sent Events
- API documentation via Swagger with JWT support

## In Progress
- Authentication and authorization implementation (structure in place but commented out)
- Memory bank documentation refinement

## Pending Work
- Enable JWT authentication (commented out in Program.cs)
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Rate limiting for administrative endpoints
- Enhanced error handling with more specific exception types
- Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed administrative data
- Add audit logging for administrative actions
- Implement monitoring and telemetry

## Known Issues
- Authentication/authorization commented out in Program.cs
- AdminController.cs is commented out and overlaps with specialized controllers
- No comprehensive audit trail for administrative actions
- Limited error handling for external service failures
- No rate limiting on administrative endpoints
- Minimal Redis cache utilization despite configuration

## Recent Milestones
- Memory bank documentation created
- Full code review completed
- Component structure documented
- FluentValidation implementation completed
- Streaming progress reporting implemented

## Next Milestones
- Enable JWT authentication
- Implement integration testing
- Develop audit logging strategy
- Evaluate caching requirements
- Implement rate limiting
- Enhance monitoring capabilities

## Performance Considerations
- Database query optimization for user and model operations
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed administrative data
- Connection pooling for database access
- Streaming implementation for large data transfers
- Pagination implementation for collection endpoints

## Security Roadmap
- Enable JWT authentication (structure already in place)
- Implement comprehensive authorization with role-based policies
- Add rate limiting for administrative endpoints
- Implement audit logging for all administrative actions
- Security review of all endpoints
- Add additional validation for sensitive operations
