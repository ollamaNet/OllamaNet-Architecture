# Progress Tracking for AdminService

## Completed Components
- Core API controllers with comprehensive endpoints:
  - UserOperationsController for complete user management
  - AIModelOperationsController for model administration
  - TagOperationsController for tag management
  - InferenceOperationsController for Ollama integration
- Service implementations with business logic:
  - UserOperationsService for user and role operations
  - AIModelOperationsService for model management
  - TagsOperationsService for tag administration
  - InferenceOperationsService for Ollama operations
- FluentValidation implementation with comprehensive validators:
  - CreateModelRequestValidator, UpdateModelRequestValidator
  - ModelTagOperationRequestValidator, SearchModelRequestValidator
  - UserAdminValidators (CreateUserRequestValidator, UpdateUserProfileRequestValidator, etc.)
- OllamaConnector for Ollama API integration
- Repository registrations and database integration via Unit of Work pattern
- Configuration for various components:
  - Database connection (SQL Server)
  - Redis caching (configured with Upstash)
  - CORS for frontend integration
  - JWT authentication (structure defined but commented out)
- Swagger documentation with JWT support
- Error handling with try/catch and appropriate status codes
- Streaming implementation for model installation progress
- Memory bank documentation

## Working Functionality
- User management (CRUD operations, search, role management, lock/unlock)
- AI model administration (create, update, delete, tag assignment)
- Tag management (create, update, delete)
- Inference operations (model info, listing, installation, removal)
- Request validation with FluentValidation
- Error handling with appropriate status codes and contextual logging
- Streaming progress for model installation via Server-Sent Events
- API documentation via Swagger with JWT support

## In Progress
- Architecture redesign according to NewSystemDesign.md
- Migration planning according to MigrationPlan.md
- Migration tracking using MigrationTracking.md

## Pending Work
### Phase 0: Preparation and Analysis
- Create new directory structure
- Analyze existing code for dependencies
- Document API contracts to ensure they remain unchanged

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Layer Setup
- Implement configuration management with options pattern:
  - Infrastructure/Configuration/ConfigurationKeys.cs
  - Infrastructure/Configuration/Options/InferenceEngineOptions.cs
  - Infrastructure/Configuration/Options/UserManagementOptions.cs
  - Infrastructure/Configuration/Options/ModelManagementOptions.cs
  - Infrastructure/Configuration/AppSettings.cs
- Create logging implementation with Serilog:
  - Infrastructure/Logging/ILoggerService.cs
  - Infrastructure/Logging/LoggerService.cs
  - Infrastructure/Logging/Models/LogEntry.cs
  - Infrastructure/Logging/Models/AuditRecord.cs
  - Infrastructure/Logging/Options/LoggingOptions.cs
  - Infrastructure/Logging/LoggingBehavior.cs
- Set up caching layer with Redis:
  - Infrastructure/Caching/CacheManager.cs
  - Infrastructure/Caching/RedisCacheService.cs
  - Infrastructure/Caching/CacheKeys.cs
  - Infrastructure/Caching/Options/RedisCacheOptions.cs
- Prepare authentication framework (commented):
  - Infrastructure/Authentication/JwtHandler.cs
  - Infrastructure/Authentication/AuthOptions.cs
  - Infrastructure/Authentication/Extensions/AuthenticationExtensions.cs
- Create integration layer for external services:
  - Infrastructure/Integration/InferenceEngine/InferenceEngineConnector.cs
  - Infrastructure/Integration/InferenceEngine/IInferenceEngineConnector.cs

### Phase 2: Domain Services Layer
- Implement domain-specific services with proper DTOs and mappers
- Reorganize services by domain (User, AIModel, Tag, Inference)
- Create DTOs and mappers for each domain

### Phase 3: Controllers and Validators
- Reorganize controllers by domain
- Move validators to domain-specific folders
- Update controllers to use new service interfaces
- Verify API contracts remain unchanged

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Validation
- Implement global exception handler
- Create custom exception types
- Ensure consistent validation responses

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- Update Program.cs with new service registrations
- Create integration tests for each domain
- Test error handling and validation
- Verify API contracts remain unchanged

### Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup
- Update Swagger documentation
- Remove obsolete files and directories
- Clean up commented code
- Update README.md with new architecture information

### Phase 7: Final Verification
- Perform final verification of the restructured service
- Verify all API contracts remain unchanged
- Conduct code review
- Verify documentation is accurate and up-to-date

## Known Issues
- Authentication/authorization commented out in Program.cs
- AdminController.cs is commented out and overlaps with specialized controllers
- No comprehensive audit trail for administrative actions
- Limited error handling for external service failures
- No rate limiting on administrative endpoints
- Minimal Redis cache utilization despite configuration
- Hard-coded values need to be moved to configuration
- Current architecture lacks proper domain separation

## Recent Milestones
- Architecture design document created (NewSystemDesign.md)
- Migration plan developed (MigrationPlan.md)
- Migration tracking document created (MigrationTracking.md)
- Memory bank documentation updated to reflect new architecture

## Next Milestones
- Complete Phase 0: Preparation and Analysis
- Implement Phase 1: Infrastructure Layer Setup
- Execute Phase 2: Domain Services Layer
- Complete Phase 3: Controllers and Validators

## Performance Considerations
- Database query optimization for user and model operations
- Caching strategy with domain-specific TTLs:
  - User profiles: 5 minutes TTL
  - User roles: 15 minutes TTL
  - Model metadata: 10 minutes TTL
  - Model tags: 15 minutes TTL
  - All tags: 30 minutes TTL
  - Tag relationships: 15 minutes TTL
  - No caching for inference operations
- Connection pooling for database access
- Streaming implementation for large data transfers
- Pagination implementation for collection endpoints

## Security Roadmap
- Enable JWT authentication (structure already in place)
- Implement comprehensive authorization with role-based policies
- Add rate limiting for administrative endpoints
- Implement audit logging for all administrative actions
- Security review of all endpoints
- Add additional validation for sensitive operations
