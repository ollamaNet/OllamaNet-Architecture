# OllamaNet High-Level Design
Here’s a suggested high-level software design for your project, broken down into key components and architectural choices. This design emphasizes modularity, scalability, and performance while meeting the requirements outlined.

## 1. **Architecture: Microservices with Event-Driven Communication**

Given the need for scalability, flexibility for model updates, and real-time performance, a **microservices architecture** is ideal. Each major function—language processing, RAG, vector database management, user management, and document handling—can be isolated into individual services, communicating over an **event-driven** architecture using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka). This will ensure a loosely coupled system where components can scale independently.

- **Primary services**:
  - **Language Processing Service**: Handles text generation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and multi-turn dialogue.
  - **RAG and Embedding Service**: Manages the embeddings and communicates with the vector database to retrieve context-relevant documents.
  - **Knowledge Management Service**: Facilitates document ingestion and extraction, creating a dynamic knowledge base.
  - **API Gateway**: A .NET gateway that handles all external requests, routing them to the appropriate services and managing access and authentication.
  - **Real-time Communication Layer**: Manages websocket or HTTP long-polling connections to provide low-latency interactions for users.

## 2. **Technology Stack**

- **.NET 6/7**: For building robust, high-performance microservices.
- **Containerization**: Using Docker and Kubernetes for deployment and orchestration, allowing independent scaling.
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven communication between services.
- **Vector Database**: FAISS or Pinecone to store and retrieve embeddings, supporting fast similarity search for RAG.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage (user data, conversation history, etc.).
- **In-Memory Cache**: Redis for caching embeddings and frequently accessed data to optimize response time.

## 3. **Core Modules**

1. **Language Processing Module**
   - **Description**: Integrates Ollama’s language models, encapsulating functionalities like text generation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and conversation handling.
   - **Components**:
     - **Model Handler**: Manages different language models (e.g., GPT-style, Llama2), selecting appropriate models based on the request.
     - **Dialogue Manager**: Maintains multi-turn conversations, leveraging session data to ensure coherent dialogue flow.
   - **Dependencies**: Requires API access to Ollama’s language models and caching for response optimization.

2. **Embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Module**
   - **Description**: Handles all embedding tasks, enabling RAG by retrieving contextually relevant documents based on user queries.
   - **Components**:
     - **Embedding Generator**: Creates embeddings for user queries and documents.
     - **Vector Store Manager**: Interacts with a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone) to retrieve relevant documents for contextual response generation.
     - **Context Aggregator**: Combines retrieved data with current user input to generate a context-aware response.

3. **Knowledge Management Module**
   - **Description**: Manages the knowledge stack by indexing and embedding documents, PDFs, and other user-uploaded content.
   - **Components**:
     - **Document Processor**: Ingests and processes uploaded documents, transforming them into chunks suitable for embedding.
     - **Data Indexer**: Creates and updates indices in the vector database for optimized retrieval.
     - **Metadata Manager**: Associates metadata (e.g., document source, creation date) with embeddings for more targeted retrieval.

4. **User and Session Management Module**
   - **Description**: Handles user authentication, session management, and user-specific data storage.
   - **Components**:
     - **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensures secure access, possibly using OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
     - **Session Manager**: Maintains active sessions, facilitating continuous multi-turn dialogues.
     - **User Profile Handler**: Stores user-specific data and preferences, enhancing personalized interaction.

5. **API Gateway and Real-Time Communication Layer**
   - **Description**: Manages all incoming API requests, provides RESTful endpoints, and enables WebSocket-based real-time communication.
   - **Components**:
     - **Request Router**: Routes API requests to appropriate microservices.
     - **Load Balancer**: Distributes requests evenly across service instances to ensure scalability.
     - **Real-Time Server**: Provides real-time, low-latency connections for interactive conversations.

## 4. **Error Handling and Monitoring**

- **Centralized Logging and Monitoring**: Use tools like **Prometheus and Grafana** for performance metrics and **ELK Stack** for centralized logging.
- **Error Recovery**: Implement a retry mechanism and dead-letter queues for handling failed requests.
- **Real-time Health Checks**: Use Kubernetes’ liveness and readiness probes to ensure service availability.

## 5. **Future-Proofing and Modularity**

The modularity of this design will accommodate future requirements, such as adding new models from Ollama or additional functionalities (e.g., translation or document summarization). Each microservice can be updated independently without affecting the entire system, facilitating easy upgrades and reduced downtime.

## 6. **Sample Workflow**

Here’s a simplified workflow for a typical user query:

1. **User Input**: User sends a text input (question or command) to the API Gateway.
2. **API Gateway** routes the input to the **Language Processing Service**.
3. **RAG Service** retrieves context-relevant documents from the vector database.
4. **Language Processing Service** generates a response using the retrieved context and returns it to the user through the **API Gateway**.
5. **Real-Time Layer** manages live interaction if the user is in an ongoing conversation.

This design provides a scalable and modular framework capable of supporting sophisticated AI-driven language processing features and ensuring the ability to evolve with future needs.
