# Product Context for ConversationService

## Business Purpose

The ConversationService is a critical component of the OllamaNet platform, responsible for managing AI-powered conversations. It serves as the backbone for persistent, organized, and context-aware interactions between users and AI models. The service enables users to create, retrieve, update, delete, and organize their conversations, as well as engage in real-time chat with AI models.

## Problems Solved

1. **Conversation Persistence**: Enables users to save and return to conversations over time, preserving context and history.

2. **Conversation Organization**: Provides folder structures and search capabilities to help users manage large numbers of conversations.

3. **Real-time Interaction**: Facilitates streaming responses from AI models for a more natural conversational experience.

4. **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation context across sessions, enabling more coherent and relevant AI responses.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Implements caching strategies to reduce latency and improve user experience.

6. **Document-Enhanced Conversations**: Enables users to upload and reference documents within conversations, with RAG capabilities for more informed AI responses.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Natural Flow**: Conversations should feel fluid and responsive, with minimal latency between user input and AI response.

2. **Contextual Awareness**: The AI should maintain awareness of the conversation history, providing coherent and relevant responses.

3. **Organizational Clarity**: Users should be able to easily organize, find, and manage their conversations.

4. **Seamless Document Integration**: Document upload, processing, and reference should be intuitive and enhance the conversation experience.

5. **Feedback Loop**: Users should be able to provide feedback on AI responses to improve future interactions.

## Target Users

1. **Knowledge Workers**: Professionals who use AI to assist with research, writing, and problem-solving.

2. **Developers**: Software engineers using AI for code assistance, debugging, and learning.

3. **Researchers**: Academic and industry researchers exploring topics with AI assistance.

4. **Content Creators**: Writers, marketers, and artists using AI for creative work.

5. **Business Professionals**: Executives, managers, and analysts using AI for decision support.

6. **Students**: Learners at all levels using AI for educational assistance.

7. **Casual Users**: Individuals using AI for personal assistance, entertainment, or curiosity.

## Business Value

1. **Enhanced Productivity**: Users can work more efficiently with AI assistance that maintains context over time.

2. **Improved AI Quality**: Persistent context and document integration lead to more relevant and helpful AI responses.

3. **Reduced Redundancy**: Users don't need to repeat information across sessions, saving time and frustration.

4. **Better Knowledge Management**: Organized conversations become a valuable knowledge repository for users.

5. **Competitive Advantage**: Superior conversation management differentiates OllamaNet from other AI platforms.

## Success Metrics

1. **Conversation Retention**: Percentage of conversations that users return to after initial creation.

2. **Response Latency**: Time between user input and AI response (target: <100ms for cached responses, <1s for new responses).

3. **User Satisfaction**: Measured through explicit feedback and implicit metrics like return rate.

4. **Cache Hit Ratio**: Percentage of requests served from cache (target: >80%).

5. **Document Processing Time**: Time to process and index uploaded documents (target: <5s for text, <30s for complex documents).

6. **Search Relevance**: Accuracy of conversation search results based on user queries.

7. **Streaming Performance**: Consistency and speed of token delivery during streaming responses.

## User Journeys

### New Conversation Journey

1. User creates a new conversation with a title and optional folder assignment.
2. User sends an initial message to the AI.
3. AI responds in real-time with streaming response.
4. User continues the conversation or adds notes/feedback.
5. Conversation is automatically saved and can be retrieved later.

### Continuing Conversation Journey

1. User browses or searches for a previous conversation.
2. User selects a conversation to continue.
3. System loads conversation history and context.
4. User sends a new message that builds on previous context.
5. AI responds with awareness of the full conversation history.

### Organizational Journey

1. User creates folders to categorize conversations.
2. User moves conversations between folders.
3. User searches across all conversations or within specific folders.
4. User deletes or archives completed conversations.

### Feedback Journey

1. User receives an AI response.
2. User provides thumbs up/down or detailed feedback.
3. Feedback is stored and associated with the specific message.
4. Feedback data is available for analysis and model improvement.

### Research Project Journey

1. User creates a new conversation for a research project.
2. User uploads relevant documents (PDFs, Word docs, text files).
3. Documents are processed, chunked, and indexed.
4. User asks questions that require information from the documents.
5. AI provides responses with citations to the uploaded documents.
6. User iteratively refines questions based on document insights.
