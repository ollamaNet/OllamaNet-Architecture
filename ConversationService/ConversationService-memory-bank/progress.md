# Progress Tracking for ConversationService

## Completed Components
- Modular folder and namespace structure implemented (Phases 1-9 complete)
- All legacy folders removed; all files are in correct locations with consistent namespaces
- Documentation and diagrams updated to reflect the new structure
- Core API controllers with comprehensive endpoints:
  - ConversationController for conversation management (CRUD, search, organization)
  - ChatController for real-time chat with streaming support
  - FolderController for folder organization operations
  - NoteController for conversation note management
  - FeedbackController for AI response feedback collection
- Service implementations with business logic:
  - ConversationService for conversation operations
  - ChatService for AI model interactions with streaming capability
  - ChatHistoryManager for history retrieval, caching, and persistence
  - FolderService for folder organization
  - NoteService for note operations
  - FeedbackService for feedback collection and management
- Caching implementation:
  - RedisCacheService for low-level Redis operations with error handling
  - CacheManager with fallback mechanisms and retry logic
  - CacheKeys for centralized key management by domain
  - Specialized cache exceptions for failure scenarios
  - RedisCacheSettings with domain-specific TTL configuration
- Ollama integration:
  - OllamaConnector with streaming and non-streaming response handling
  - Integration with Ollama via ngrok endpoint
  - Streaming pattern implementation with IAsyncEnumerable
- Security components:
  - JWT authentication with 30-day token lifetime
  - Role-based authorization policies (Admin, User)
  - FluentValidation implementation for request validation
  - Proper error handling with status code mapping
- Data access integration:
  - Repository pattern via Ollama_DB_layer
  - Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
  - Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
- API documentation:
  - Swagger/OpenAPI implementation
  - Response type attribution for API clarity
  - HTTP status code documentation

## Working Functionality
- Conversation management:
  - Creation with model selection and folder organization
  - Retrieval with pagination and folder filtering
  - Update of conversation details
  - Deletion (hard and soft)
  - Movement between folders
  - Basic search capability (to be enhanced)
- Real-time chat:
  - Non-streaming message endpoint
  - Streaming response with Server-Sent Events
  - Chat history management and persistence
  - System message support
- Folder organization:
  - Hierarchical folder structure
  - CRUD operations for folders
  - Folder-based conversation filtering
- Note management:
  - Note creation for conversations
  - Note CRUD operations
  - Conversation-specific note retrieval
- Feedback collection:
  - User feedback on AI responses
  - Feedback management and retrieval
- Caching system:
  - Redis-based distributed caching with Upstash
  - Domain-specific caching strategies
  - Fallback mechanisms to database
  - Cache invalidation on data mutations
- Security implementation:
  - JWT authentication via Bearer tokens
  - User-specific resource access control
  - Request validation with detailed error responses
- Error handling:
  - Controller-level try/catch blocks
  - Appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Detailed error logging with performance timing

## In Progress
- Feature enhancements: advanced search, caching optimization, conversation archiving, rate limiting, error handling, and integration testing
- Ongoing optimization of caching strategies for large conversation histories
- Implementation of conversation archiving strategy

## Pending Work
- Full implementation of advanced search functionality (currently returning regular pagination)
- Performance optimization for large conversation histories
- Rate limiting for chat endpoints to prevent abuse
- Enhanced error handling for Redis connection failures
- Background processing improvements for post-streaming operations
- Comprehensive integration testing suite
- Monitoring and telemetry implementation
- Conversation archiving and purging strategy
- Enhanced audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Known Issues
- Search functionality is limited and returns regular pagination results instead of actual search
- Caching strategy may need optimization for large conversation datasets
- No comprehensive error handling for Redis connection failures
- Background processing for post-streaming operations uses Task.Run without proper monitoring
- Missing rate limiting on chat endpoints could lead to potential abuse
- Limited audit trail for security-sensitive operations
- No automatic chat history pruning for long conversations
- ConversationService.GetConversationsAsync uses in-memory filtering that could be optimized
- ChatHistoryManager.SaveStreamedChatInteractionAsync lacks proper error recovery

## Recent Milestones
- Migration to modular, best-practices folder and namespace structure completed (Phases 1-9)
- Memory bank documentation reviewed and aligned with current architecture
- Integration with Upstash Redis for distributed caching
- Implementation of Server-Sent Events for streaming responses
- ChatHistoryManager with caching support implemented
- Specialized cache exception hierarchy established
- Full code review completed with identified optimization opportunities

## Next Milestones
- Implement enhanced search functionality with proper indexing
- Optimize cache strategy for conversation history with size-based limits
- Develop integration testing approach for critical paths
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Enhance error handling for external service failures
- Develop monitoring strategy with performance metrics
- Implement conversation archiving for older conversations

## Performance Considerations
- Database query optimization for conversation and message retrieval
- Caching strategy refinement for conversation history
- Redis connection pooling configuration
- Streaming implementation with backpressure handling
- Large conversation history management with pagination
- In-memory operations optimization for conversation filtering
- Background processing with proper resource management

## Security Roadmap
- JWT token security review and refresh token implementation
- Rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Input validation hardening
- Comprehensive audit logging for security-sensitive operations
- Security review of all endpoints with penetration testing
- Role-based access control refinement for more granular permissions
- Data retention policy implementation
