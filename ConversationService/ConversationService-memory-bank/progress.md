# ConversationService Progress

## Current Status

The ConversationService is fully operational with all core features implemented. The codebase has been completely refactored into a modular, best-practices folder structure with proper separation of concerns. All legacy code has been removed, and the service now follows a clean architecture pattern with distinct layers for API, Service, Infrastructure, and Data Access.

## Completed Tasks

### Core Features

- ✅ RAG Document Processing feature fully implemented
- ✅ Complete migration to modular, best-practices folder structure
- ✅ API controllers for all domain entities
- ✅ Service implementations with proper interfaces
- ✅ Comprehensive caching strategy with Redis
- ✅ Inference engine integration with streaming support
- ✅ Security implementation with JWT authentication
- ✅ Data access layer with Entity Framework Core

### RAG System

- ✅ Document upload and storage
- ✅ Document processors for multiple formats (PDF, Word, Text, Markdown)
- ✅ Text extraction and chunking pipeline
- ✅ Embedding generation via InferenceEngine
- ✅ Pinecone integration for vector storage
- ✅ Context retrieval for enhanced AI responses

### Service Discovery

- ✅ RabbitMQ integration for service discovery
- ✅ Dynamic configuration updates for service endpoints
