- Background processing for post-streaming operations uses Task.Run without proper monitoring
- Missing rate limiting on chat endpoints could lead to potential abuse
- Limited audit trail for security-sensitive operations
- No automatic chat history pruning for long conversations
- ConversationService.GetConversationsAsync uses in-memory filtering that could be optimized
- ChatHistoryManager.SaveStreamedChatInteractionAsync lacks proper error recovery
