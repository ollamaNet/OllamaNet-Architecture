# Active Context for ConversationService

## Current Focus
- Completing comprehensive memory bank documentation for the ConversationService
- Refining the implementation of conversation management, chat interactions, and folder organization
- Optimizing the Redis caching implementation for conversation history and streaming responses
- Addressing limitations in the search functionality identified in codebase review
- Planning conversation archiving strategy for data management

## Recent Changes
- Memory bank documentation created with comprehensive architectural details
- Detailed analysis of the Redis caching implementation with identified enhancements
- Review of streaming response implementation with potential optimizations
- Documentation of service patterns and architecture with component relationships
- Identification of search functionality limitations (currently returning regular pagination)

## Current Status
- ConversationService is fully implemented with comprehensive functionality:
  - Conversation management (create, read, update, delete, move, search)
  - Real-time chat with both streaming and non-streaming endpoints
  - Folder organization with hierarchical structure
  - Note creation and management for conversations
  - Feedback collection on AI model responses
- Redis-based caching implemented with Upstash:
  - Domain-specific caching keys and TTL values
  - Fallback mechanisms to database on cache miss
  - Specialized exception handling for cache operations
  - Performance monitoring with Stopwatch
- Streaming responses implemented via Server-Sent Events:
  - IAsyncEnumerable pattern in OllamaConnector
  - Direct response streaming with Response.BodyWriter
  - Background processing for post-streaming operations
- JWT authentication enabled with 30-day token lifetime
- OllamaConnector integration with ngrok endpoint
- FluentValidation set up for comprehensive request validation
- Error handling with specific HTTP status codes and logging

## Active Decisions
- Multi-layered caching strategy with redis-based distributed caching via Upstash
- Server-Sent Events for streaming AI responses with background processing
- Folder-based organization for conversations with hierarchical structure
- JWT authentication with claims-based user identification
- Repository pattern with Unit of Work for database access
- Streaming pattern with IAsyncEnumerable and Response.BodyWriter
- Cache-aside pattern with database fallback for resilience
- In-memory filtering for conversation search (to be enhanced)

## Implementation Insights
- ChatHistoryManager handles both caching and database interaction for conversation history
- ConversationService.GetConversationsAsync uses in-memory filtering that could be optimized
- Streaming implementation in ChatController uses direct Response.BodyWriter approach
- CacheManager implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Search functionality is marked with TODO comments for enhancement
- RedisCacheSettings configures domain-specific TTL values for different data types
- OllamaConnector connects to an Ollama instance via ngrok endpoint

## Next Steps
- Enhance search functionality by implementing proper database-level search
- Optimize caching strategy for conversation history to handle large conversations
- Implement conversation archiving mechanism for data management
- Add rate limiting to protect chat endpoints from abuse
- Enhance error handling for Redis connection failures and external service errors
- Implement background job monitoring for post-streaming operations
- Add comprehensive integration testing for critical paths

## Open Questions
- What is the optimal approach for implementing full-text search for conversations?
- How should conversation history be pruned or archived for long-running conversations?
- What metrics should be collected for monitoring service performance?
- How should streaming response performance be optimized for high-concurrency scenarios?
- What rate limiting strategy would be most effective for chat endpoints?
- How can the background processing tasks be monitored and managed effectively?

## Current Context
The ConversationService is a comprehensive microservice providing conversation management, real-time chat capabilities, content organization, and feedback collection for the OllamaNet platform. It implements advanced features including Redis-based distributed caching with Upstash, Server-Sent Events for streaming AI model responses, and integration with Ollama AI models via a ngrok endpoint. 

The service uses a clean architecture pattern with controllers, domain-specific services, a caching layer, and data access through a shared database layer. Currently, the main development priorities are enhancing the search functionality (which currently returns regular pagination results), optimizing caching for conversation history, implementing a conversation archiving strategy, and adding rate limiting to protect endpoints.

Key technical implementations include the ChatHistoryManager, which integrates with Redis caching for efficient history retrieval, the streaming pattern in ChatController using Response.BodyWriter for real-time responses, and the cache-aside pattern with fallback in CacheManager for resilient operations.
