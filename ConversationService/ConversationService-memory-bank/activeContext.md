# Active Context for ConversationService

## Current Focus
- Feature enhancements: advanced search, caching optimization, conversation archiving, rate limiting, error handling, and integration testing
- Ongoing optimization of Redis caching for conversation history and streaming responses
- Planning and implementing conversation archiving strategy for data management
- Monitoring and improving background processing for post-streaming operations

## Recent Changes
- Migration to modular, best-practices folder and namespace structure completed (Phases 1-9)
- All legacy folders removed; all files are in correct locations with consistent namespaces
- Documentation and diagrams updated to reflect the new structure
- Memory bank documentation reviewed and aligned with current architecture
- Redis caching and streaming response implementation reviewed and optimized

## Current Status
- ConversationService is fully implemented and organized according to modern .NET microservice best practices:
  - Modular folder structure with domain-specific services, DTOs, and mappers
  - Comprehensive API for conversation, chat, folder, note, and feedback management
  - Real-time chat with streaming and non-streaming endpoints
  - Redis-based distributed caching with Upstash
  - Server-Sent Events for streaming AI responses
  - JWT authentication and role-based authorization
  - FluentValidation for request validation
  - OllamaConnector integration for AI model inference
  - Error handling and logging implemented
- Documentation and diagrams are up to date and reflect the current architecture

## Active Decisions
- Continue with feature enhancements: advanced search, caching optimization, archiving, rate limiting, and integration testing
- Maintain modular structure and best practices for all new features
- Monitor and optimize performance and error handling

## Implementation Insights
- ChatHistoryManager integrates caching and database for efficient history retrieval
- Modular structure enables clear separation of concerns and maintainability
- RedisCacheSettings and CacheManager provide domain-specific caching strategies
- Streaming implementation leverages IAsyncEnumerable and Response.BodyWriter
- Error handling and logging are centralized and consistent

## Next Steps
- Implement advanced search functionality with database-level search
- Optimize caching for large conversation histories
- Develop and implement conversation archiving mechanism
- Add rate limiting to chat endpoints
- Enhance error handling for Redis and external service failures
- Expand integration testing for critical paths
- Monitor and improve background processing for streaming operations

## Open Questions
- What is the optimal approach for implementing full-text search for conversations?
- How should conversation history be pruned or archived for long-running conversations?
- What metrics should be collected for monitoring service performance?
- What rate limiting strategy would be most effective for chat endpoints?
- How can background processing tasks be monitored and managed effectively?

## Current Context
The ConversationService is now a fully modular, best-practices .NET microservice providing conversation management, real-time chat, content organization, and feedback collection for the OllamaNet platform. The codebase is clean, maintainable, and ready for future enhancements, with all documentation and diagrams up to date. The current focus is on feature enhancements and performance optimization.
