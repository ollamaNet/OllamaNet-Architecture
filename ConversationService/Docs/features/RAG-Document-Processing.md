# RAG Document Processing Feature

## Overview

The RAG Document Processing feature enables users to upload documents to conversations, process them for text extraction, and use the content to enhance AI responses through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Key Features

1. Document Upload and Management
   - Support for multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX, MD)
   - Secure file storage
   - Document metadata management

2. Text Processing
   - Format-specific text extraction
   - Document chunking for RAG
   - Metadata extraction

3. RAG Integration
   - Vector embedding generation
   - Context retrieval
   - AI response enhancement

## High-Level Flow

1. User uploads document to a conversation
2. System processes and stores the document
3. Document text is extracted and chunked
4. Chunks are embedded and stored in vector database
5. RAG system uses document context in conversations

## Success Criteria

1. Technical
   - Support all specified document formats
   - Secure document storage
   - Efficient text extraction
   - Reliable RAG integration

2. User Experience
   - Fast upload and processing
   - Seamless conversation integration
   - Relevant context retrieval
   - Enhanced AI responses

## Quick Start

### Document Upload

```http
POST /api/documents
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
    "file": <file>,
    "conversationId": "string"
}
```

### Document Processing

Processing starts automatically after upload, but can be triggered manually:

```http
POST /api/documents/{id}/process
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
    "options": {
        "chunkSize": 500,
        "chunkOverlap": 50
    }
}
```

### RAG Integration

The processed document will be automatically available for RAG in conversations:

```http
POST /api/chat/messages
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
    "conversationId": "string",
    "message": "Query about the document content"
}
```

## Implementation Details

The RAG Document Processing feature has been fully implemented according to the design documentation. The implementation includes:

1. Document upload and storage with multiple format support
2. Format-specific document processors for PDF, Text, Word, and Markdown
3. Text extraction and chunking for RAG
4. Enhanced RagIndexingService for document chunks with metadata
5. Security features including content validation and access control
6. Performance monitoring with processing metrics
7. Comprehensive error handling and logging

All components have been integrated into the ConversationService and are now operational.
