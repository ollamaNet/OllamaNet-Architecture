# RAG Document Processing Feature Overview

## Purpose

The RAG Document Processing feature enables users to upload documents to conversations, process them for text extraction, and use the content to enhance AI responses through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Key Features

1. Document Upload and Management
   - Support for multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX, MD)
   - Secure file storage
   - Document metadata management

2. Text Processing
   - Format-specific text extraction
   - Document chunking for RAG
   - Metadata extraction

3. RAG Integration
   - Vector embedding generation
   - Context retrieval
   - AI response enhancement

## High-Level Flow

1. User uploads document to a conversation
2. System processes and stores the document
3. Document text is extracted and chunked
4. Chunks are embedded and stored in vector database
5. RAG system uses document context in conversations

## Success Criteria

1. Technical
   - Support all specified document formats
   - Secure document storage
   - Efficient text extraction
   - Reliable RAG integration

2. User Experience
   - Fast upload and processing
   - Seamless conversation integration
   - Relevant context retrieval
   - Enhanced AI responses
