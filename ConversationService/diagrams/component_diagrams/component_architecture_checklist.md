- [ ] Processor Interface ‚Üí Implementation mappings

## Clarifying Questions ‚ùì

1. **Component Granularity**
   - What level of detail should be shown for each component?
   - Should helper classes be shown as separate components?

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Are there any internal components not exposed via interfaces?
   - Are there any custom middleware components to include?

3. **Component Lifecycle**
   - Are there any initialization dependencies between components?
   - Are there any components with special lifecycle requirements?

4. **Error Handling**
   - How do components handle and propagate errors?
   - Are there specific error handling components?

5. **Shared Services**
   - Are there any shared services used across multiple domains?
   - How are cross-cutting concerns addressed?

## Component Architecture Elements ‚úèÔ∏è

1. **API Controllers**
   - Show controller components with their main responsibilities

2. **Domain Services**
   - Show service components with their interface contracts

3. **Infrastructure Services**
   - Show infrastructure components with their interface contracts

4. **Cross-Cutting Components**
   - Show validators, middleware, and other shared components

5. **Component Relationships**
   - Show dependencies between components with direction
   - Highlight key data flows between components

## Additional Notes üìù

- The diagram should show interface-implementation relationships
- Focus on showing the public interfaces between components
- Group related components (e.g., all document processors)
- Highlight extension points in the architecture
- Show validation flow from controllers through validators to services
- Document key patterns used (Repository, Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- Note where dependency injection is used to connect components
