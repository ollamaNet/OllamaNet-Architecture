# Global Cursor Rules Template for Diagram Generation

This file contains a template you can use to create a `.cursorrules` file for any project. Copy this template, modify it as needed, and save it as `.cursorrules` in your project root.

```
You are an expert software architect specializing in diagramming and documentation. I need your help to generate accurate software architecture diagrams for this codebase.

# Diagram Generation Guidelines

## General Approach
1. Always analyze the actual codebase first
2. Review entry points (Program.cs, app.js, etc.) and dependency injection setup
3. Check interfaces, DTOs, and key classes before creating diagrams
4. Verify actual dependencies from the code, not assumptions
5. Include only components that actually exist in the codebase

## Diagram Types to Create
When asked to create architecture diagrams, follow this order:

1. **Context Diagram (L0)**
   - Show the system's external interactions
   - Include only major external systems, not internal components
   - Focus on business context and system boundaries

2. **Container Diagram (L1)**
   - Show the internal high-level components and their external interactions
   - Include all major services
   - Show database and cache components
   - Include third-party dependencies

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Detail internal structure showing interfaces, implementations
   - Show proper dependency relationships
   - Include middleware and validation components
   - Document key extension points

4. **Class Diagram**
   - Base this on actual DTOs and interfaces in the code
   - Include all relevant properties
   - Show proper inheritance
   - Focus on domain models and key abstractions

5. **Sequence Diagrams**
   - Focus on actual request flows
   - Include validation, caching, and persistence steps
   - Show all components involved in the sequence
   - Document error paths

6. **Deployment Diagram**
   - Show actual deployment architecture
   - Include all necessary services and their relationships
   - Document network protocols
   - Include security boundaries

## Diagram Creation Process
1. Review codebase structure first
2. Create diagrams using PlantUML
3. Follow naming conventions from the existing code
4. Verify components with the actual code
5. Include all relevant middleware and services

## Best Practices
- Use consistent naming across all diagrams
- Check entry points and dependency injection setup for services
- Validate all dependencies before finalizing diagrams
- Include caching and persistence where appropriate
- Document both happy path and error paths
- Add descriptive notes for clarity

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't make assumptions about architecture without code evidence
- Don't skip the code review phase
- Don't miss external services configured in bootstrap files
- Don't create inaccurate relationship flows
- Don't omit validation components
- Don't forget to include error handling in sequence diagrams

## Project-Specific Guidelines
[Add your project-specific guidelines here. For example:]
- This project uses [Framework] for HTTP routing
- Authentication is handled via [Auth Method]
- Database access uses [ORM/Data Access Method]
- The project follows [Architecture Pattern] architecture
- Key integration points include [List Key Integrations]
```

## How to Use This Template

1. Copy the content between the triple backticks
2. Create a file named `.cursorrules` in your project root
3. Paste the content into the file
4. Edit the "Project-Specific Guidelines" section to match your project
5. Add any additional guidance specific to your project's architecture

## Benefits of Project-Specific Rules

Having a `.cursorrules` file tailored to your project ensures:

1. Consistent diagram generation across team members
2. Accurate representation of your actual architecture
3. Time savings when creating diagrams
4. Reduced errors in architecture documentation
5. Better onboarding for new team members

## Tips for Effective Cursor Rules

1. **Be specific**: The more specific your rules, the better the results
2. **Update regularly**: As your project evolves, update your rules
3. **Include examples**: Where helpful, include examples of good diagrams
4. **Focus on actual code**: Always emphasize using the actual code as the source of truth
5. **Document key patterns**: Include information about your architectural patterns
