## General Implementation Tips

1. **Start with Questions**
   - Answer all clarifying questions first
   - Document assumptions
   - Validate understanding with team

2. **File Review Process**
   - Start with high-level files
   - Move to specific implementations
   - Note any discrepancies
   - Document unclear areas

3. **Detail Gathering**
   - Use a checklist for required details
   - Mark missing information
   - Note areas needing clarification
   - Document design decisions

4. **Validation Steps**
   - Review with technical team
   - Validate against code
   - Check for missing components
   - Verify relationships

5. **Documentation**
   - Note key decisions
   - Document assumptions
   - List open questions
   - Include relevant code references

## Using This Plan

1. For each diagram type:
   - Review the files listed
   - Answer clarifying questions
   - Gather required details
   - Create initial draft
   - Validate and refine

2. Keep track of:
   - Answered questions
   - Outstanding issues
   - Design decisions
   - Implementation notes

3. Update diagrams when:
   - New components are added
   - Flows change
   - States are modified
   - Integrations change
