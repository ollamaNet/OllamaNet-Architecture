## Clarifying Questions ‚ùì

1. **Class Scope**
   - Which specific classes are most important to include?
   - Are there any classes that should be excluded due to complexity?
   
   **Answer:** Most important classes include service interfaces (IChatService, IConversationService, IDocumentManagementService), infrastructure interfaces (ICacheManager, IDocumentStorage, IOllamaConnector), document processor hierarchy (IDocumentProcessor and implementations), and key DTOs for each domain (Chat, Conversation, Document, Feedback, Note, Rag). Highly detailed implementation classes can be excluded if they don't contribute to understanding the overall architecture.

2. **DTO Relationships**
   - How do request and response DTOs relate to each other?
   - Are there inheritance relationships between DTOs?
   
   **Answer:** Request DTOs flow to services while response DTOs flow from services. Most DTOs have a direct correspondence (e.g., CreateConversationRequest ‚Üí CreateConversationResponse) but don't typically inherit from each other. Instead, they form logical pairs within each domain's workflow.

3. **Service Relationships**
   - What are the key dependencies between services?
   - Are there any circular dependencies?
   
   **Answer:** Key dependencies include: ChatService depends on RagRetrievalService and OllamaConnector; DocumentProcessingService depends on various document processors; RagIndexingService depends on TextEmbeddingGeneration and PineconeService. Services are designed to avoid circular dependencies through careful interface design and dependency injection.

4. **Infrastructure Implementation**
   - What are the key implementation details for infrastructure components?
   - Are there any complex infrastructure relationships?
   
   **Answer:** Document storage uses file system abstraction; caching uses Redis implementation; RAG uses Pinecone for vector storage and Ollama for embeddings. These components are connected through interfaces that abstract their functionality, with configuration options that parameterize their behavior.

5. **Mapping Strategy**
   - How are objects mapped between layers?
   - Are there any complex mapping relationships?
   
   **Answer:** Each service domain has dedicated mapper classes that transform between DTOs and internal models. Mapping is generally straightforward, with mappers following consistent patterns across the system. Complex mappings (if any) would be isolated in specific mapper classes to maintain clean service implementations.
