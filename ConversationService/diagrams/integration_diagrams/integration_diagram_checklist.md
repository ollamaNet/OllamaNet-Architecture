## Clarifying Questions ‚ùì

1. **External Service Dependencies**
   - What are all external services the system integrates with?
   - How are these integrations configured and managed?
   - Are there any fallback mechanisms for external service failures?
   
   **Answer:** The system integrates with multiple external services: Ollama LLM service for text generation and embeddings, Pinecone for vector database storage and retrieval, SQL database for structured data, Redis for caching, and authentication services. These integrations are configured through options classes containing connection parameters, API keys, and behavior settings. Fallback mechanisms include retry patterns, circuit breakers for preventing cascading failures, and graceful degradation when services are unavailable.

2. **Service Communication**
   - How do services communicate with each other?
   - What authentication mechanism is used between services?
   - How are service boundaries defined?
   
   **Answer:** Services communicate primarily through REST API calls with standardized request/response patterns. Authentication between services likely uses JWT tokens or API keys propagated through request headers. Service boundaries are clearly defined through interface contracts, with each service having well-defined responsibilities and data ownership. The API Gateway handles routing, authentication verification, and request forwarding.

3. **Event Processing**
   - Are there any event-driven integrations?
   - How are background tasks managed?
   - Is there any message queuing or event bus integration?
   
   **Answer:** The system uses background processing for document handling and asynchronous operations for non-blocking user experiences. Document processing is handled through fire-and-forget operations that update status as processing progresses. While not explicitly mentioned, the system might employ background services or hosted services for managing long-running tasks and background processing.

4. **Error Handling**
   - How are integrations tested?
   - Are there any mock implementations for testing?
   - How are integration failures simulated and tested?
   
   **Answer:** Integration testing likely uses mock implementations of external services to simulate different scenarios without requiring actual external connections. The interface-based architecture facilitates easy mocking for testing. Failures would be simulated by configuring mocks to throw exceptions or return error responses, allowing testing of retry logic, circuit breakers, and fallback strategies.

5. **Integration Monitoring**
   - How are integration points monitored?
   - What metrics are collected for integrations?
   - How are integration failures detected and alerted?
   
   **Answer:** Integration points are likely monitored through logging, metrics collection, and potentially health checks. Key metrics would include response times, error rates, and availability of external services. Failures would be detected through exception logging, failed health checks, and monitoring of retry attempts, with alerting mechanisms to notify system administrators of persistent issues.
