## Clarifying Questions ‚ùì

1. **Conversation Lifecycle**
   - What are all possible states for a conversation?
   - What triggers state transitions?
   - Are there any automated state changes?

2. **Document Processing**
   - What is the complete lifecycle of a document?
   - How are processing errors handled?
   - Are there any document expiration or archival states?

3. **Chat Session Management**
   - How are chat sessions initialized and terminated?
   - What states exist during streaming vs. non-streaming?
   - How are interrupted sessions handled?

4. **RAG Processing**
   - What states exist during document indexing?
   - How is query processing state managed?
   - Are there any background processing states?

5. **Error Recovery**
   - What recovery mechanisms exist for each error state?
