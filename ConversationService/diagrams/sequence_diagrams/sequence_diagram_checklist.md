## Clarifying Questions ‚ùì

1. **Flow Boundaries**
   - Where does each flow start and end? - each request start from the Controller endpoint and end with its response track in the each controller one by one to get better context finish each one before starting to the next you can find the controllers in the `ConversationService\Controllers`
   - Are there any cross-flow dependencies? - Document processing flow connects to RAG indexing flow; Service discovery flow affects Chat flow through InferenceEngineConnector

2. **Error Handling**
   - What are the key error scenarios for each flow? - returning exception classes and try-catch statements
   - How are errors propagated back to the client? - using exception classes and messages.
   - How are RabbitMQ and Redis connection failures handled? - using resilience policies and fallback mechanisms

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - When and how is caching used in each flow? for the chat we retrieve the chat history.
   - What is the cache invalidation strategy? - invalidate on update/delete operations
   - How is configuration data cached and retrieved? - stored in Redis with fallback to default values

4. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Which operations are handled asynchronously? - document processing and indexing, message consumption
   - How are long-running operations managed? - background tasks, hosted services
   - How are message consumers registered and started? - as hosted services in the dependency injection container

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - How are streaming responses handled? - server sent events
   - How do configuration updates affect ongoing operations? - updates are applied to new requests without interrupting current operations

6. **Service Discovery**
   - How does the service discover and update InferenceEngine URLs? - through RabbitMQ messages from Admin Service
   - What happens when a new URL is received? - validated, stored in Redis, and notified to dependents
   - How are URL validation failures handled? - invalid URLs are logged and rejected
