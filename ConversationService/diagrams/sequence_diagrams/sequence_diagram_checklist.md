  - Delayed operations

## Error Paths to Include ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Validation Errors**
  - Invalid request handling
  - Validation response

- [ ] **Authentication Errors**
  - Unauthorized access handling

- [ ] **Business Logic Errors**
  - Domain-specific error handling
  - Not found conditions

## Clarifying Questions ‚ùì

1. **Flow Boundaries**
   - Where does each flow start and end? - each request start from the Controller endpoint and end with its response track in the each controller one by one to get better context finish each one before starting to the next you can find the controllers in the `ConversationService\Controllers`
   - Are there any cross-flow dependencies? - Document processing flow connects to RAG indexing flow

2. **Error Handling**
   - What are the key error scenarios for each flow? - returning exception classes and try-catch statements
   - How are errors propagated back to the client? - using exception classes and messages.

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - When and how is caching used in each flow? for the chat we retrieve the chat history.
   - What is the cache invalidation strategy? - invalidate on update/delete operations

4. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Which operations are handled asynchronously? - document processing and indexing
   - How are long-running operations managed? - background tasks

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - How are streaming responses handled? - server sent events

## Sequence Diagram Elements ‚úèÔ∏è

1. **Actors**
   - Client/User
   - API Gateway

2. **System Components**
   - Controllers
   - Validators
   - Services
   - Infrastructure components
   - External systems

3. **Message Flows**
   - Synchronous calls
   - Asynchronous calls
   - Return values
   - Exceptions

4. **Conditional Logic**
   - Decision points
   - Alternative paths
   - Error conditions

5. **Parallel Operations**
   - Concurrent processing
   - Asynchronous operations

## Special Focus Areas ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Streaming Chat Flow**
  - How are streaming responses managed?
  - What happens after streaming completes?

- [ ] **RAG Integration**
  - How and when is RAG context retrieved?
  - How is it integrated with the chat prompt?

- [ ] **Document Processing Pipeline**
  - How do different document processors work?
  - How is content extracted and processed?

- [ ] **Caching Strategy**
  - What is cached and when?
  - How is cache invalidation handled?

## Consistent Styling for Sequence Diagrams üé®

Use the following PlantUML styling for all sequence diagrams:

```plantuml
!define ACCENT_COLOR #4285F4
!define SECONDARY_COLOR #34A853
!define WARNING_COLOR #FBBC05
!define ERROR_COLOR #EA4335

!define SUCCESS #34A853
!define WARNING #FBBC05
!define FAILURE #EA4335

skinparam ParticipantPadding 20
skinparam BoxPadding 10
skinparam SequenceArrowThickness 1
skinparam SequenceGroupHeaderFontStyle bold

skinparam sequence {
    ArrowColor #5C5C5C
    LifeLineBorderColor #CCCCCC
    LifeLineBackgroundColor #EEEEEE
    
    ParticipantBorderColor #CCCCCC
    ParticipantBackgroundColor #FFFFFF
    ParticipantFontColor #000000
    
    ActorBorderColor #CCCCCC
    ActorBackgroundColor #FFFFFF
    ActorFontColor #000000
}
```

## Additional Notes üìù

- Focus on one complete flow per diagram
- Include timing information where relevant
- Document both happy path and error paths
- Show caching operations explicitly
- Include validation steps and error handling
- Note any asynchronous operations
- Highlight important conditional logic
- Include database interactions
- Show external service calls
- Use consistent color scheme across all diagrams
