## Clarifying Questions ‚ùì

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - What specific caching patterns are implemented?
   - How is cache invalidation handled?
   - What happens during cache failures?  - fallback and call the dadtabase

2. **Document Storage**
   - Is storage purely local or are there cloud components? - currently its local but in the future the normal action is to be cloud do act as its a cloud blob storage
   - How is document security implemented? you can find this in the appsettings.json
   - What is the file organization strategy? you can check the `ConversationService\Infrastructure\Document\Storage\FileSystemDocumentStorage.cs`

3. **Vector Database Integration**
   - How is the vector database connection configured? - its cofigured through the `ConversationService\Infrastructure\Rag\VectorDb\PineconeService.cs`
   - What indexing strategies are used? 
   - How are query operations optimized? 

4. **LLM Integration**
   - How is the LLM service connection managed? -using the ollama connector class
   - What fallback mechanisms exist for LLM failures? returning an exception (for now)
   - How is request/response streaming handled? 

5. **Service Mesh**
   - How do services discover and communicate with each other? - with updating the service urls manually (for now)
   - How is authentication propagated between services? - usign the api gateway
