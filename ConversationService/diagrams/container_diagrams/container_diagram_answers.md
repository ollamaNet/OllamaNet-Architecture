# Answers to Container Diagram Clarifying Questions

## 1. Service Boundaries

- **Cross-service dependencies:**
  - The `ChatService` depends on `RagRetrievalService` to retrieve relevant document context for enhanced responses
  - The `DocumentProcessingService` depends on `RagIndexingService` to index document chunks in the vector database
  - The `ChatService` depends on `ChatHistoryManager` for history management and caching
  - The `OllamaConnector` is used by both `ChatService` and `TextEmbeddingGeneration` services

- **Circular dependencies:**
  - No obvious circular dependencies are present in the design
  - Services follow a clean hierarchical dependency pattern from Controllers → Services → Infrastructure → External Systems

## 2. Infrastructure Integration

- **Caching layer integration:**
  - The `CacheManager` implements a sophisticated caching strategy with fallback mechanisms
  - `ChatHistoryManager` uses caching to store and retrieve conversation history
  - `FolderService` and `ConversationService` invalidate cache entries when data changes
  - Redis is used as the underlying cache implementation with configuration for timeouts, retries, and fallbacks

- **Document storage dependencies:**
  - `DocumentManagementService` and `DocumentProcessingService` depend on `IDocumentStorage` for file operations
  - `FileSystemDocumentStorage` is the concrete implementation that stores documents on the local filesystem

- **RAG capability usage:**
  - `ChatService` uses `RagRetrievalService` to enhance responses with document context
  - `DocumentProcessingService` uses `RagIndexingService` to store document chunks in the vector database
  - Both depend on the Pinecone vector database and Ollama embedding generation

## 3. Data Flow Patterns

- **Primary flow for conversation and chat:**
  1. Client sends request to `ChatController`
  2. Request is validated by `ChatRequestValidator`
  3. `ChatService` loads history using `ChatHistoryManager` (from cache or database)
  4. `RagRetrievalService` is used to get relevant context if RAG is enabled
  5. `OllamaConnector` is called to generate response from the LLM
  6. Response is saved to database and cached
  7. Response is returned to client (streaming or non-streaming)

- **Document processing integration:**
  1. Document is uploaded via `DocumentController`
  2. `DocumentManagementService` stores the file using `FileSystemDocumentStorage`
  3. `DocumentProcessingService` extracts content using format-specific processors
  4. Text is chunked and each chunk is indexed via `RagIndexingService`
  5. `RagIndexingService` creates embeddings using Ollama and stores them in Pinecone
  6. Documents become available for context retrieval in chat flows

- **Conversation history management:**
  - `ChatHistoryManager` handles retrieval and storage of conversation history
  - History is cached in Redis for fast access with configurable expiration
  - Invalidation happens on updates to conversation data

## 4. Technical Patterns

- **Mediator/Event patterns:**
  - No explicit mediator pattern or event-based communication is used
  - Communication primarily happens through direct service dependencies

- **Background workers:**
  - Asynchronous background processing is used during document processing
  - History saving after streaming responses happens in a non-blocking Task.Run

- **Validation handling:**
  - FluentValidation is used across API boundaries with validators registered in DI
  - Controllers validate input using specific validators for each request type

## 5. Performance Considerations

- **Caching strategies:**
  - Tiered caching strategy with in-memory and Redis caching
  - Cache entries have type-specific expiration times
  - Sophisticated error handling with retry mechanisms and fallbacks
  - Sensitive data like conversation history is cached to avoid repeated database queries

- **Performance-critical paths:**
  - Document processing and embedding generation are potentially long-running operations
  - Streaming chat responses require efficient handling of SSE (Server-Sent Events)
  - Vector similarity search for RAG can be performance-intensive with large datasets
