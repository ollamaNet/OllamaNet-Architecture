## Container Components to Identify ‚úÖ

- [ ] **API Layer**
  - Controllers that expose RESTful endpoints
  
- [ ] **Service Layer**
  - Chat service container
  - Conversation service container
  - Document management container
  - Document processing container
  - Feedback service container
  - Folder service container
  - Note service container
  - RAG services container
  
- [ ] **Infrastructure Layer**
  - Caching infrastructure
  - Document storage infrastructure
  - LLM connector infrastructure
  - RAG infrastructure (Embedding, Vector DB)
  
- [ ] **External Dependencies**
  - Database
  - Redis Cache
  - LLM Inference Engine
  - Vector Database
  - Document Storage

## Relationships to Document ‚úÖ

- [ ] **API to Service Layer**
  - Controller to service dependencies
  
- [ ] **Service to Service Dependencies**
  - e.g., Chat service using RAG services
  
- [ ] **Service to Infrastructure Dependencies**
  - Service dependencies on caching
  - Service dependencies on document storage
  - Service dependencies on LLM connector
  
- [ ] **Infrastructure to External Systems**
  - Caching to Redis
  - Document storage to file system
  - LLM connector to inference engine
  - RAG to vector database

## Data Flows to Capture ‚úÖ

- [ ] **User Requests Flow**
  - API request handling path
  
- [ ] **Conversation Data Flow**
  - Conversation creation and management
  
- [ ] **Document Processing Flow**
  - Document upload, storage, and processing
  
- [ ] **RAG Integration Flow**
  - Document indexing and retrieval for context

## Clarifying Questions ‚ùì

1. **Service Boundaries**
   - Are there any cross-service dependencies not obvious from interfaces?
   - Are there any circular dependencies between services?

2. **Infrastructure Integration**
   - How does the caching layer integrate with each service?
   - Which services depend on document storage?
   - Which services utilize the RAG capabilities?

3. **Data Flow Patterns**
   - What is the primary flow for conversation and chat interactions?
   - How does document processing integrate with conversations?
   - How is conversation history managed between services?

4. **Technical Patterns**
   - Is there a mediator pattern or any event-based communication?
   - Are there any background workers or scheduled processes?
   - How is validation handled across the API boundary?

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Are there any caching strategies specific to certain components?
   - Are there any performance-critical paths in the system?

## Container Diagram Elements ‚úèÔ∏è

1. **API Layer**
   - REST API Controllers (grouped by domain)

2. **Service Layer**
   - Domain-specific service containers

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Cross-cutting infrastructure components

4. **External Dependencies**
   - External systems from context diagram

5. **Relationships**
   - Dependencies between containers
   - Data flows with direction

## Additional Notes üìù

- The system follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between:
  - API layer (Controllers)
  - Service layer (Business Logic)
  - Infrastructure layer (Technical Components)
  
- Services are organized by domain, with each domain having its own folder
  
- Infrastructure components are shared across services
  
- The RAG system provides document-based context enhancement
  
- Document processing is extensible with format-specific processors
